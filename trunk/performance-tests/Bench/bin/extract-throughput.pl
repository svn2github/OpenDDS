=head1 NAME

extract-throughput.pl - extract summary statistics from test results.

$Id$

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  extract-throughput.pl <infile> ...

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This script processes the logfiles created by executing the througput
tests and generates a series of indexed data sets suitable for plotting
by GNUPlot.

All input files named on the command line are processed and the transport
used, the message sizes and rates, as well as the elapsed test time and
actual number of messages received are extracted.

The input files are expected to be in logfile format as produced by the
testprocess C<-v> option.  Logfiles produced by the subscription end of
the testing contain the data required to produce plottable data sets.

The supported tests that can be reduced from the pre-configured throughput
tests:

=begin html

<table border>
  <tr><th>Test Type</th></tr>
  <tr><td>Bidirectional Throughput</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Publication Bound</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Subscription Bound</td></tr>
</table>

=end html

=begin text

      Bidirectional Throughput
      Publication Bound
      Subscription Bound

=end text

=begin man

      Bidirectional Throughput
      Publication Bound
      Subscription Bound

=end man

Each of these test types has a pre-configured set of test conditions that
can be executed.  The sets of test conditions are grouped into three
different categories:

=begin html

<table border>
  <tr><th>Test Conditions</th><th>Description</th></tr>
  <tr><td>Steepest Ascent</td><td>A group of tests that simultaneously
  increase both the message size and message rate resulting in a large
  nominal throughput increase between tests.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Fixed Rate</td><td>A group of tests where the message rate is
  held constant for all of the tests.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Fixed Size</td><td>A group of tests where the message size is
  held constant for all of the tests.</td></tr>
</table>

=end html

=begin text

      Steepest Ascent: A group of tests that simultaneously increase both
                       the message size and message rate resulting in a
                       large nominal throughput increase between tests.
      Fixed Rate:      A group of tests where the message rate is held
                       constant for all of the tests.
      Fixed Size:      A group of tests where the message size is held
                       constant for all of the tests.

Each index set in the output represents the combination of a test type,
a set of test conditions, and a transport type with each entry within
the index representing a single size/rate test result.

The output data within an index is formatted as a comma separated value
file (CSV), with the following fields:

=begin html

<table border>
  <tr><th>Field</th><th>Description</th></tr>
  <tr><td>1</td><td>test message size</td></tr>
  <tr><td>2</td><td>test message rate</td></tr>
  <tr><td>3</td><td>actual (measured) bandwidth</td></tr>
  <tr><td>4</td><td>test type</td></tr>
  <tr><td>5</td><td>transport type</td></tr>
</table>

=end html

=begin text

      Field  1: test message size
      Field  2: test message rate
      Field  3: actual (measured) bandwidth
      Field  4: test type
      Field  5: transport type

=end text
