        * dds/DCPS/DataWriterImpl.cpp:
        * dds/DCPS/PublisherImpl.cpp:

          When deleting a data writer, wait until all control messages
          sent during unregistering of instances have been accounted before
          proceeding after unregistering instances.  This avoid a later pure
          virtual function call occurring trying to access a message block
          that has been deleted.

Fri Jun 13 19:02:31 UTC 2014  Peter Oschwald  <oschwaldp@ociweb.com>

          To alleviate deadlock when calling send_delayed_notifications, made possible
          deadlocking calls take a match on the sender's repoId so that only its own
          associated WriteDataContainer lock is acquired while sending the delayed
          notifications.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/DataLink.h:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/DataLink.inl:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/DataLink.cpp:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/DataLinkSet.h:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/DataLinkSet.inl:

          Modified send_stop(_i) interface to pass sender's repoId for use
          in the TransportSendStrategy when calling send_delayed_notifications
          to pass a match for which delayed notifications to send.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/ThreadPerConnectionSendTask.cpp:

          ThreadPerConnectionSendTask still calls send_delayed_notification
          with no matchby passing in GUID_UNKNOWN into the send_stop call
          this should be okay, since only one thread is accessing the sending
          data so no deadlocks will happen

          modified execute to pass GUID_UNKNOWN as a paramerter to send_stop_i
          due to element being null, so no sender repoId is available to pass.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/TransportClient.cpp:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/TransportSendStrategy.h:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/TransportSendStrategy.cpp:

          When send() calls send_delayed_notifications it now passes in a match
          on the elem being sent's publication id.

        * docs/history/ChangeLog-writerlocks_2:

          Merged the branch "writerlocks_2" For details see the branch-specific
