          Refactored to remove redundant code. Generate sequence entities
          for pre-defined CORBA types. This way we don't have to include
          any *.pidl based ini files in order to use CORBA::typeSeq values.

        * MPC/config/gen_dissector.mpb:

          Added new base project to facilitate the generation of dissector
          configuration files.

        * tools/dissector/packet-opendds.h:
        * tools/dissector/sample_manager.cpp:

Wed Jul 27 14:09:35 UTC 2011  Adam Mitz  <mitza@ociweb.com>

        * tools/excelRTD/ExcelRTD.mpc:

          Use MPC's built-in support for generating an escaped quoted
          that works with all MPC project types.

Tue Jul 26 22:31:46 UTC 2011  Don Hudson  <hudsond@ociweb.com>

        * tools/excelRTD/ExcelRTD.mpc:

          Corrected generation directory of moc file and moved midl file to
          Source_Files so MPC doesn't confuse it with a TAO IDL file.

        * dds/idl/wireshark_generator.cpp:

          Added generator of wireshark dissector configuration files. To
          run, add "-Gws" to the opendds_idl command line. Running on
          <filename>.idl yields <filename>_ws.ini in the local directory.
          This *_ws.ini file can then be used by the wireshark dissector
          to process sample data messages.

        * tools/dissector/packet-repo.cpp:

          Fixed a couple of compiler warnings. Added decomposition of
          content filter ID values, enabled the parsing of inforepo
          messages without first storing the inforepo ior in "IOR.txt" for
          wireshark.

        * tools/dissector/sample_dissector.cpp:
        * tools/dissector/sample_manager.h:
        * tools/dissector/sample_manager.cpp:

          Added "CORBA::<typename>" as an alternative basic type id for
          parsing. The idl compiler emits C++ mapped types rather than the
          original CORBA IDL type name for predefined types. User
          specified types are used as-is. Also, translations between string
          types were simplified, favoring std::string where ever posible.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/TransportConfiguration.cpp:

          parameter dump headings.

          Excel Real-Time Data (RTD) Server for OpenDDS.
          Initial support is for repository monitor tree data that is supplied
          to stand-alone monitor application.  The RTD server uses many of the same
          files as the stand-alone monitor application.

        * tools/excelRTD/OpenDDS.xlam:

          Excel Add-in for OpenDDS.  Initial support is for repository monitor
          tree view that mirrors the stand-alone repository monitor application, but
          with support for:

            + Monitoring multiple repositories (will also allow for filtered views in future)
            + Automatically restarting monitoring when a previously saved workbook that
              contains monitors is opened.
            + Snapshoting of a monitor tree either in-place or to another location in the workbook.

        * tools/monitor/MonitorData.cpp:
        * tools/monitor/MonitorTask.h:
        * tools/monitor/MonitorTask.cpp:

          Added optional constructor parameter so existing IOR keys aren't loaded.
          This is to support running multiple instances of MonitorTask by the OpenDDS Excel RTD Server.

        * tools/monitor/MonitorDataModel.h:
        * tools/monitor/MonitorDataModel.cpp:

          Added optional parameter to getNode(index) to control whether the root node or null is returned if the
          node is invalid.

        * tools/monitor/MonitorTask.cpp:

          Corrected typo in comment.

        * tools/monitor/TreeNode.h:

          Added accessor method to get children.

        * tools/monitor/MonitorTask.cpp:
        * tools/monitor/Viewer.cpp:

          Moved clean up of OpenDDS service resources to Viewer because the OpenDDS Excel RTD Server
          can launch multiple MonitorTasks.
