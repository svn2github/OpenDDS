          Added null pointer check that Coverity reported was missing.

        * tests/DCPS/FooTest5/publisher.cpp:

          Avoid null dereference check after Coverity reported such a
          dereference was possible.

        * dds/DCPS/ZeroCopySeq_T.cpp:

          Remove ZeroCopySeq::decrement_reference() which was only
          being called by code that implemented DataReaderImpl::take_generic().
          This function had questionable semantics anyway since it
          wasn't clear what the expected behavior was if the reference
          count went to zero.
