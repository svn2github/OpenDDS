        * dds/DCPS/DataReaderImpl.cpp:

          If a single message is both dispose & unregister,
          the message block needs to be duplicated so that each
          operation can read the key fields.

        * dds/DCPS/RTPS/Spdp.h:
        * dds/DCPS/RTPS/Spdp.cpp:

          Use a separate buffer for writing instead of sharing the
          one used for reading.  The initial implementation never
          overlapped reads and writes, but now receiving data from
          a new remote participant causes our announcement to be
          sent immediately.

        * dds/DCPS/RTPS/Sedp.cpp:

          Interoperability fix for discovery with Content-Filtered
          Topics: certain fields must be non-empty strings even
          though they are not needed.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/rtps_udp/RtpsUdpDataLink.cpp:

          Fixed two corner cases for DURABILITY QoS:
          - Removed the work-around from Wed Dec 19 16:34:05 UTC 2012,
            it is not needed due to Thu Jan 10 16:06:08 UTC 2013 and removing
            the work-around improves interoperability.
          - If the nacked range is entirely below the durable data range,
            a Gap submessage is needed so that the reader can proceed to the
            higher sequence numbers.

        * examples/DCPS/ishapes/ShapesDialog.cpp:
        * examples/DCPS/ishapes/main.cpp:

          If the PARTITION QoS is non-default, add it to the
          window's title bar so it is visible in the UI.
