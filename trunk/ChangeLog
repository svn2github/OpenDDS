        * dds/DCPS/DataReaderImpl.cpp:

          Correct spelling and scope errors introduced by the last
          check-in that was done *prior* to compilation.  Ordering is
          everything...

        * dds/DCPS/RTPS/RtpsDiscovery.h:
        * dds/DCPS/RTPS/RtpsDiscovery.cpp:

          Changed "DefaultMulticastGroup" configuration key to
          "InteropMulticastOverride" to indicate the semantics better.
          Added some documentation.

          multicast group specification.  The default port added this way
          is 7401.
          Added some documentation.

        * tests/DCPS/RtpsDiscovery/rtps_disc_group.ini:

Fri May 10 15:48:28 UTC 2013  Adam Mitz  <mitza@ociweb.com>

        * dds/idl/HTemplate.txt:

          Added nested typedefs to the generated FooTypeSupportImpl class
          in order to facilitate template programming using these types.

          Demonstrate the use of templates with the typedefs mentioned above.
          This removes quite a bit of duplicated and almost-duplicated code
          from the test which uses 4 topics and 3 topic types.

        * dds/DCPS/DataReaderImpl.cpp:
          Decouple the DataReader from the ContentFilteredTopic as
          part of the delete_datareader call instead of doing it
          in the destructor.

Mon Apr 22 18:41:38 UTC 2013  Byron Harris  <harrisb@ociweb.com>

        * tests/DCPS/SubscriberCycle/SubscriberCycle.mpc:

Fri Apr 19 19:19:48 UTC 2013  Adam Mitz  <mitza@ociweb.com>

        * DDS_TAOv2.mwc:

          Don't build SubscriberCycle test for DDS build
          with content filtered topics disabled. Complete
          fix from previous commit so builds using an
          install of OpenDDS.

        * tests/DCPS/SubscriberCycle/Subscriber.cpp:

          Fixed warning about signed/unsigned comparison.

Mon Apr 15 15:47:37 UTC 2013  Byron Harris  <harrisb@ociweb.com>

Wed Apr 10 20:19:29 UTC 2013  Byron Harris  <harrisb@ociweb.com>

        * dds/DCPS/DataReaderImpl.cpp:

          During cleanup cancel any deadline watchdog timers associated
          with the reader. This fixes a problem when the reader's subscriber
          is deleted in one thread while deadline timeout handling in the
          watchdog thread tries to access the deleted subscriber.

          A test that creates/deletes a subscriber multiple times while
          a publisher is contining to publish samples. This test was
          used to activate the deadline handling code trying to access
          a deleted subscriber and verify the fix. The test has a
          number of command line options described in the README that
          can be used to help identify if there are other issues with
          subscriber deletion in the presence of sample processing.

          to access File's private constructor.

Wed Mar 27 19:44:12 UTC 2013  Byron Harris  <harrisb@ociweb.com>

Tue Mar 12 21:31:08 UTC 2013  Adam Mitz  <mitza@ociweb.com>

        * dds/DCPS/DataReaderImpl.cpp:

          If a single message is both dispose & unregister,

        * dds/DCPS/RTPS/Sedp.cpp:

          Interoperability fix for discovery with Content-Filtered
          Topics: certain fields must be non-empty strings even
          though they are not needed.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/rtps_udp/RtpsUdpDataLink.cpp:

          Fixed two corner cases for DURABILITY QoS:
          - Removed the work-around from Wed Dec 19 16:34:05 UTC 2012,
            it is not needed due to Thu Jan 10 16:06:08 UTC 2013 and removing
            the work-around improves interoperability.
          - If the nacked range is entirely below the durable data range,
            a Gap submessage is needed so that the reader can proceed to the
            higher sequence numbers.

        * examples/DCPS/ishapes/ShapesDialog.cpp:
        * examples/DCPS/ishapes/main.cpp:

          If the PARTITION QoS is non-default, add it to the
          window's title bar so it is visible in the UI.
