        * tests/DCPS/unit/MyTypeSupportImpl.h:

          Remove pure virtual function DataReaderImpl::take_generic()
          which wasn't being used anywhere.

        * dds/DCPS/ZeroCopySeq_T.h:
        * dds/DCPS/ZeroCopySeq_T.cpp:

          Remove ZeroCopySeq::decrement_reference() which was only
          being called by code that implemented DataReaderImpl::take_generic().
          This function had questionable semantics anyway since it
          wasn't clear what the expected behavior was if the reference
          count went to zero.
