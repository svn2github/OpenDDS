        * DDS_TAOv2.mwc:

          Include a directory instead of an mpc file for IORTable.
          Allows more flexibility for changes in different TAO versions.

Fri Apr 19 17:30:19 UTC 2013  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * dds/DCPS/DataReaderImpl.cpp:

Thu Apr 18 17:47:40 UTC 2013  Byron Harris  <harrisb@ociweb.com>

        * bin/dcps_tests.lst:

          Don't run SubscriberCycle test for DDS build
          with content filtered topics disabled.

        * tests/DCPS/SubscriberCycle/SubscriberCycle.mpc:

          Don't build SubscriberCycle test for DDS build
          with content filtered topics disabled. Complete
          fix from previous commit so builds using an
          install of OpenDDS.

        * tests/DCPS/SubscriberCycle/Subscriber.cpp:

          Fixed warning about signed/unsigned comparison.

Mon Apr 15 15:47:37 UTC 2013  Byron Harris  <harrisb@ociweb.com>

        * tests/DCPS/SubscriberCycle/SubscriberCycle.mpc:

          DDS::ContentFilteredTopic_ptr.

Fri Apr 12 14:14:23 UTC 2013  Adam Mitz  <mitza@ociweb.com>

        * DDS_TAOv2.mwc:

          Added DynamicInterface to the list of TAO libraries used.
          The DOC Group version now requires it for IORTable.

        * tests/DCPS/SubscriberCycle/SubscriberListenerImpl.cpp:

          Fixed Visual C++ compile error.

Wed Apr 10 20:19:29 UTC 2013  Byron Harris  <harrisb@ociweb.com>

        * dds/DCPS/DataReaderImpl.cpp:

          During cleanup cancel any deadline watchdog timers associated
          with the reader. This fixes a problem when the reader's subscriber
          is deleted in one thread while deadline timeout handling in the
          watchdog thread tries to access the deleted subscriber.

          A test that creates/deletes a subscriber multiple times while
          a publisher is contining to publish samples. This test was
          used to activate the deadline handling code trying to access
          a deleted subscriber and verify the fix. The test has a
          number of command line options described in the README that
          can be used to help identify if there are other issues with
          subscriber deletion in the presence of sample processing.

Wed Mar 27 20:05:13 UTC 2013  Byron Harris  <harrisb@ociweb.com>

        * dds/DCPS/FileSystemStorage.h:

          Reverting previous change after discovering GNU C++
          incorrectly allowed template based Directory::Iterator
          to access File's private constructor.

Wed Mar 27 19:44:12 UTC 2013  Byron Harris  <harrisb@ociweb.com>

        * dds/DCPS/FileSystemStorage.h:

        * tests/DCPS/ManyTopicMultiProcess/run_test.pl:

          Added a missing unlink statement for the repo ior file.


Tue Mar 12 21:31:08 UTC 2013  Adam Mitz  <mitza@ociweb.com>

        * dds/DCPS/DataReaderImpl.cpp:

          If a single message is both dispose & unregister,
          the message block needs to be duplicated so that each
          operation can read the key fields.

        * dds/DCPS/RTPS/Spdp.h:
        * dds/DCPS/RTPS/Spdp.cpp:

          Use a separate buffer for writing instead of sharing the
          one used for reading.  The initial implementation never
          overlapped reads and writes, but now receiving data from
          a new remote participant causes our announcement to be
          sent immediately.

        * dds/DCPS/RTPS/Sedp.cpp:

          Interoperability fix for discovery with Content-Filtered
          Topics: certain fields must be non-empty strings even
          though they are not needed.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/rtps_udp/RtpsUdpDataLink.cpp:

          Fixed two corner cases for DURABILITY QoS:
          - Removed the work-around from Wed Dec 19 16:34:05 UTC 2012,
            it is not needed due to Thu Jan 10 16:06:08 UTC 2013 and removing
            the work-around improves interoperability.
          - If the nacked range is entirely below the durable data range,
            a Gap submessage is needed so that the reader can proceed to the
            higher sequence numbers.

        * examples/DCPS/ishapes/ShapesDialog.cpp:
        * examples/DCPS/ishapes/main.cpp:
