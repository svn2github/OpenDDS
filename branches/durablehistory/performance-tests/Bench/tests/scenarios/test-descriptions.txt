Some testing scenarios

NOTATION:
filenames are abbreviations for the following constructs:
  scenario<i>-process<j>
with the abbreviated filenames appearing as:
  s<i>-p<j>.ini

within a file, publications and subscriptions are described.  To fully
specify these, participants and topics need to be defined as well.  If
the scenario does not require more than one of these (participants or
topics) then they may be implied in the brief synopses below.

In general the intent is to execute the different processes on different
hosts - at least to the extent that the majority of data traffic is
actually carried by a network and not transferred via the loopback
interface.

For example to run scenario 2 on 3 hosts you could execute the following
processes on each host:

  Host1: -s s2-p1.ini,s2-p5.ini
  Host2: -s s2-p2.ini,s2-p4.ini
  Host3: -s s2-p3.ini,s2-p6.ini

Or with only 2 hosts:

  Host1: -s s2-p1.ini,s2-p3.ini,s2-p5.ini
  Host2: -s s2-p2.ini,s2-p4.ini,s2-p6.ini
