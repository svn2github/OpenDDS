ishapes - QT GUI application for testing OpenDDS RTPS interoperability.

This code has been adapted from The Simple DDS API
(SIMD http://code.google.com/p/simd-cxx), and can be used to demonstrate
OpenDDS RTPS interoperability with other DDS vendors.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
DIRECTORIES:

images/
  -- Contains image resources used by this application.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
FILES:

*.ui
  -- Qt4 designer files specifying the UI for the application.

ishape.qrc
  -- Resource specification file, managed by Qt4 designer.

ishape.mpc
  -- MPC project file for the application.

*.{hpp,cpp}
  -- source code for application.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Code notes:

The GUI source code files are compiled by the Qt meta-object compiler and
have certain macros and other non-standard language constructs that are
parsed by that system.

This means that it is not recommended to run a style utility on the GUI
files, as the Qt specific elements may no longer be recognizable by the
Qt tools.
