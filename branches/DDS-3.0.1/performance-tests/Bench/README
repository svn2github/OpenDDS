This directory contains support for executing tests across a distributed
environment.  It includes test source code, scripts and package building
tools for creating and executing distributed tests.

Directories here include:
  bin   - target for built executables and location of test execution
          scripts.
  doc   - more detailed descriptions of the testing, its setup and
          execution.
  etc   - location of test configuration information.
  lib   - target for built link libraries and Perl modules.
  src   - location of test source code.
  tests - location of test scenario configuration data.
  tools - location of packaging and support tools.

NOTE: At this time, these tests and scripts are written for a Unix-style
      environment only.  They rely on the use of the bash shell
      interpreter and expect the ability to execute remote commands via
      ssh.
