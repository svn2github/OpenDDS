        * dds/DCPS/DataSampleListElement.h:
        * dds/DCPS/DataSampleListElement.inl:

          Split out the DataSampleListElement into its own class instead of
          an imbedded struct in DataSampleList.  Made its pointers to list
          positions private and added the DataSample*List classes friends so
          that they can manage the element's internal pointers.

          Added setters and getters for pointers to next and previous send samples
          to support current code usage.  These should hopefully be done away with
          in the future and not allow direct manipulation or access to these internals.

          Left other data members as public for the moment, but hope to shift most to
          private.

        * dds/DCPS/DataSampleList.h:
        * dds/DCPS/DataSampleList.inl:
        * dds/DCPS/DataSampleList.cpp:

          Made the DataSampleList an abstract base class for concrete derived list types:
            -DataSampleSendList
            -DataSampleInstanceList
            -DataSampleWriterList

          Added initial declaration and definitions of derived lists member functions within
          existing DataSampleList.(h,cpp,inl).  Made previous DataSampleList's member functions
          for managing element pointers into generalized enqueue_tail, dequeue_head, dequeue
          functionality specific to the concrete derived list type.  These methods are pure virtual
          in abstract base class and each derived list type concretely defines them per old
          implementations.

          Provided accessors and mutators for the head_, tail_, and size_ datamembers to control
          access to the DataSampleList's internals which were being directly accessed from outside
          the class.  The mutators at least should hopefully go away with a more controlled design
          in future iterations.

        * dds/DCPS/DataDurabilityCache.cpp:
        * dds/DCPS/DataDurabilityCache.h:
        * dds/DCPS/DataWriterImpl.h:
        * dds/DCPS/DataWriterImpl.cpp:
        * dds/DCPS/PublicationInstance.h:
        * dds/DCPS/RTPS/Sedp.cpp:
        * dds/DCPS/ReplayerImpl.cpp:
        * dds/DCPS/WriteDataContainer.h:
        * dds/DCPS/WriteDataContainer.cpp:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/TransportClient.h:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/TransportClient.cpp:
        * tests/DCPS/unit/Main.cpp:
        * tests/transport/rtps/publisher.cpp:
        * tests/transport/rtps_reliability/rtps_reliability.cpp:
        * tests/transport/simple/SimpleDataWriter.cpp:

          Updated DataSampleList's to be the appropriate derived type as well as correctly calling
          member functions for operations on the lists.  Used helper functions to control access
          to head_, tail_, and size_ data members which are now private.  Did provide a setter for
          these members for this initial implemenation so that the operation wouldn't be changed yet.

        * dds/DCPS/DataSampleList.h:

          Added initial declaration of iterator to use for the three new list types
          and initial declaration of DataSampleWriterList to use as a sample list
          used by data writers.
