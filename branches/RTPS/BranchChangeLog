        * dds/DCPS/RTPS:

          Copied the trunk version -- it didn't come over in the merge.

        * dds/DCPS/Serializer.h:
        * dds/DCPS/Serializer.inl:
        * dds/DCPS/Serializer.cpp:

          - Strings (narrow only) are now CDR-compliant: they include the null
            terminator byte even though there is no reason to have it.
          - Alignment (CDR rules) can be enabled with an optional 3rd
            constructor argument.
          - Removed unused methods and data members.

        * dds/idl/marshal_generator.cpp:

          gen_max_marshaled_size() and gen_find_size() need to know about the
          modified string serialization.
          Note that these are not yet updated for alignment.

        * tests/DCPS/Compiler/idl_test1_main/main.cpp:
        * tests/DCPS/Compiler/idl_test3_main/main.cpp:

          Updated expected sizes now that strings are CDR-compliant.

        * tests/DCPS/Serializer/SerializerTest.cpp:

          Test that the Serializer with alignment options enabled still
          generates a byte stream that can be de-serialized correctly.
          Still need to test that all CDR alignment rules were followed.

        * tools/dissector/sample_dissector.cpp:

          Updated to account for changed string serialization.  Needs testing.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/multicast/BestEffortSession.h:

          Fixed an artifact of svn merge (duplicated lines).

        * tests/DCPS/Serializer/.cvsignore:

          Removed this file.

        * tests/DCPS/KeyTest:

          Re-added from trunk.  Merging this directory didn't work so it was
          removed in the last commit.

Wed Aug 24 16:01:03 UTC 2011  Adam Mitz  <mitza@ociweb.com>

        * Merged from trunk r4455 through r4906.
          Previous work on this branch was incorporated in the trunk as of
          Wed May 18 21:32:29 UTC 2011  Adam Mitz  <mitza@ociweb.com>
          and therefore the previous BranchChangeLog entries have been cleared.
          They can now be found in docs/history/ChangeLog-RTPS-1.
