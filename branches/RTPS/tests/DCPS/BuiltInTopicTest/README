A test for built-in-topic implementation.

Test steps:

1) start InfoRepo
2) start monitor1 process which just create a domain participant. It reads bit data
   via bit datareader after a few seconds.
3) start publisher which create a domain participant and a datawriter.
4) start subscriber which create a domain participant and a datareader.
5) start monitor2 process which just create a domain participant and read the bit
   data via bit datareader.


The monitor1 and monitor2 should both get following bit info.

 4 domainparticipants,
 2 topics,
 1 datareader
 1 datawriter


The test log was redirected to a file since it has an error on the InfoRepo during
shutdown. The problem is the InfoRepo bit datawriter try to dispose samples upon
remove_association for a remote bit datareader, the dispose() sends the control messages
to each associated link while the remote is shutting down and remove_association came
after.
