This test is a scalability test that creates a large number of subscriber
processes on a single topic and then writes to them with a single
publishing process with multiple threads and/or writers.  It stresses the
system in two major ways.  First, the large number of readers in different
processes forces a large number of connections and the data published to
be shared by all these connections.  Second, the writers writing on separate
threads must share the common resources of these connections.

To run this test, use the run_test.pl script.  When run with no parameters
it starts 4 publishing threads (each with its own writer) and 500 subscribing
processes.  It can also be passed the number of writers and readers. For
example:

        ./run_test.pl 20 20

runs the test with 20 writers and 20 readers.
