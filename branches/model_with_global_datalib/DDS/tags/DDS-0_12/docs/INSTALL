BUILDING DDS
========================

* Supported platform:

  We have built DDS examples on Win32 using Visual Studio .NET 2003 (VC 7.1)
  and Visual Studio 2005 (VC 8), as well as gcc 3.3 on Solaris/x86, and gcc 3.4
  and 4.x on Linux.

* Compiling:

    DDS requires the TAO PortableServer and dependent libraries to build.  It
    is preferable to have a complete build of TAO's core (every library under
    $TAO_ROOT/tao) before attempting to build DDS.

  1 Build ACE and TAO.

    See the instructions in ACE_wrappers/ACE-INSTALL.html and
    ACE_wrappers/TAO/TAO-INSTALL.html or the relevant sections
    in OCI's TAO Developer's Guide.

  2 Set the environment variables.

    Set DDS_ROOT to the location of the DDS checkout.

    Add $DDS_ROOT/bin to the PATH (on, windows add %DDS_ROOT%\bin)

    Add $DDS_ROOT/lib to the LD_LIBRARY_PATH (or %DDS_ROOT%\lib to
    the PATH for windows)

    Make sure that MPC_ROOT and the other normal ACE/TAO environment
    variables are defined.

  3 Generate the makefiles.

    DDS uses MPC for generating makefiles or project files.

     On linux or Solaris:
      cd $DDS_ROOT
      perl $ACE_ROOT/bin/mwc.pl -type gnuace DDS.mwc

     On Windows:
      cd %DDS_ROOT%
      perl %ACE_ROOT%\bin\mwc.pl -type [InsertCompilerType] DDS.mwc
        "CompilerTypes" tested include vc71, vc8, and nmake


  4 Build

    On linux or Solaris:
    make

    On Windows:
    load the DDS solution (or workspace) into visual studio and
    build all.


  5 Test

    cd $DDS_ROOT/tests
    $DDS_ROOT/bin/auto_run_tests.pl
