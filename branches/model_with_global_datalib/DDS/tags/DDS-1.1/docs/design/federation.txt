Federated DDS InfoRepo objects.

  This discussion assumes a familiarity with the OMG Data Distribution
  Service as well as the OpenDDS implementation of that service.
  Processes which incarnate objects that implement the OpenDDS InfoRepo
  CORBA IDL interface are the subject of this discussion.  These
  processes are considered as a repository in the following discussion.

  Federating one or more repositories allows multiple, possibly
  preexisting, DDS services to operate a single DDS service.  This allows
  the possibility of joining existing services as well as providing a
  mechanism to tolerate the failure of one or more repositories without
  degradation of service.

Context

  For this discussion we assume applications using separate DDS services
  provisioned by dedicated repositories.  Each application can be attached
  to one or more repositories.  Today, each repository provides a service
  segment for a disjoint set of (DDS defined) domains.  This means that
  there is no interaction between the repositories required or allowed.
  Federation of the repositories allows the separate services to operate
  as a single DDS service.

  Applications are constrained to obtain all information about any
  individual DDS domain from a single repository.  This is required by
  the current implementation allowing an application to attach to more
  than a single repository.  What this means to applications is that
  all service entities created for a domain must be obtained from the
  same repository.  This does not limit the application functionally or
  impede federation of repositories in any way.

  Individual repositories are required to distinguishable within a
  federation of repositories.  This is done through the use of a unique
  repository identifier value.  This value must be unique among all
  repositories that are to be federated at run time.  This is similar
  to the problem of identifying interfaces, such as using a hardware
  MAC address or a unique interface IP address.  The assignment and
  management of these identifiers is beyond the scope of the federation
  mechanism and is assumed for this purpose.  This implementation of
  federation has chosen to identify repositories using a unique 32
  bit Id value.  Any given repository Id value is expected to refer
  to the same repository for the lifetime of that repository and any
  federation that it is a part of.  That is repository Id values should
  not be changed by any repository within its lifetime.  And a federation
  should never reuse an Id value to identify a different repository.

  *** If a repository is killed and restarted, is it appropriate to
      assign the same Id value?

Repositories

  Each repository manages the service information for OpenDDS
  Service_Participants which have attached to the repository.  This
  information consists of Topic (and TopicDescription), Participant,
  Publication and Subscription data, along with the transport connection
  information for endpoints and established associations between
  publications and subscriptions as well as policy information for
  the entities.  This information is referenced by an internal Id value
  generated within the repository.  This internal Id value is unique
  only within a single repository and no attempt is made to synchronize
  these values between repositories.  This value is also used within
  the Service_Participants (within the applications) to manage active
  associations between publications and subscriptions.

  Any individual repository will be allowed to join a federation of
  repositories (including a federation of a single other repository) at
  any time and in any state.  The resulting federated repositories are
  likely to have conflicting internal Id values referencing different
  service entities.  That is an internal Id value may be the same in
  two different repositories but may reference different objects, in
  value as well as type, within the different repositories.  In order
  to not require synchronization between repositories prior to them
  becoming federated, entities are referenced within the federation of
  repositories by a tuple that includes the unique repository Id as well
  as the internal Id value.

  This implementation has defined a FederatedId value that contains two
  Long components, one of which contains the 32 bit unique repository Id
  and the other which contains the 32 bit internal reference Id value.
  A value of this FederatedId type is sufficient to identify each object
  within a collection of repositories regardless of their federation state
  as long as each repository has a unique repository Id.  The structure
  of the FederatedId type allows easy identification of the originating
  repository and the internal reference Id value within that repository.
  This is useful for ownership and synchronization considerations.

  Federated repositories contain information originating with themselves
  as well as shared data that originated from other repositories.  Any
  DDS service object will be created within a single repository, which
  will retain ownership of the object, with the information and any
  updates published to any federated repositories.

  For most service entities: DomainParticipant, Publications and
  Subscriptions, there will never be a valid reason for any application
  other than the creating application from modifying the entity.
  This means that for data other than Topic and TopicDescription data,
  there will only ever be a single repository that will update the data.
  This means that the FederatedId value of the entities are fixed for
  their lifetime.  It also allows identification of the only repository
  which is allowed to update the entities.

  Topic and TopicDescription data presents an issue of how to synchronize
  similar entities when joining a federation.  While this issue is
  solvable, the initial implementation of federation does not require
  this synchronization and has opted instead to constrain the original
  creator of a Topic (and associated TopicDescription) to be updated by
  the originating application only.

  This leaves the case where the Topic and associated TopicDescription
  are identical which needs to be handled.  This can occur when a
  repository that has been associated looses connectivity to a federation
  and then later rejoins.  In this case, both the data values and the
  FederatedId value identifying the data will be identical and needs only
  to be checked.  Federation will not be allowed for a new repository
  attempting to join if this check fails.

  In order to allow the ability of updating from any repository in the
  future an ownership passing request/grant or a read-for-ownership
  interface can be implemented.  This is not done in the initial
  implementation.  All strategies for synchronizing data over
  a distributed layer are time consuming and open to problems with
  deadlock if resources are unreliable or become unavailable.  They are
  discouraged for all but those applications requiring the capability
  and willing to accept the cost of incorporating error recovery or
  fault tolerance mechanisms.

  Federation of repositories is implemented by adding a Federator object
  to each repository process.  This Federator has a CORBA IDL interface
  defined to allow other repositories to join and leave the federation
  as well as its own DDS service publications of FederationTopics.  Note
  that these FederationTopics are a superset of the DDS service defined
  BuiltinTopics.  The BuiltinTopics are not sufficient to subscribe to
  since they do not carry OpenDDS specific implementation data required
  to correctly allow federated operation.  The transport interface data
  associated with Publications and Subscriptions is an example of this
  kind of data.

  When a repository desires to join a federation, it locates an existing
  repository within the federation and makes a remote call to it to
  give the federation its own Federator interface IOR and then creates
  a DomainParticipant for the DDS domain in which the FederationTopics
  of the remote repository are published.  It then subscribes to the
  remote repository FederationTopics.  When the remote repository is
  processing the request to join the federation, it makes a call back to
  the joining repository and attempts to join it as a separate federation.
  The end result is that after the remote calls complete, each repository
  now subscribes to the others FederationTopics and has a reference to
  the control interface to make federation management calls with.

Applications

  Applications participate in a DDS service by attaching to one or more
  repositories.  A repository retains information about all service
  entities created within a domain which it manages for that application.
  An application contains a Service_Participant which retains references
  to all attached repositories and local service entities.  Each Publisher
  and Subscriber entity within an application is associated with one (and
  only one) transport object.  Each transport object manages connections
  and associations between Publications and Subscriptions by tracking
  them with the internal repository Id value discussed above.  This is
  the source of the constraint on applications being required to create
  all entities within a single domain from a single repository.

  DataSamples are published and sent over transport mechanisms along
  with additional information used by the DDS service in their delivery.
  Part of the service information included in the sample message contains
  a publication Id value.  This identifies the source of the DataSample.
  This value must be unique within the set of possible publications.
  With a federated set of repositories, this can include subscriptions
  created by more than a single repository, which means that the full
  FederatedId value described above is needed to identify the publication.
  Since a transport needs to be able to place this FederatedId value into
  a message, a translation from the available internal repository Id value
  to the FederatedId value required in the message.  This translation
  is done by looking up the mapping in a table within the application
  managed remotely by the repository.

  Since any transport will need to translate between its own internal
  Id value to a FederatedId value, each repository attached to an
  application will have manage a separate mapping.  These mappings are
  located within the applications Service_Participant which is where the
  multiple repository attachments are made as well.  Outbound messages
  will have the FederatedId value added to them by the transport.
  Incoming messages will have the received FederatedId value translated
  back to the specific repository Id value within the transport as well.

Communications

  Communications between repositories which become federated is performed
  through a combination of CORBA IDL interfaces and the publication and
  subscription to federation information using the DDS service itself.
  The interfaces are used to control the federation of the repositories.
  They allow repositories to become connected and federated, unconnected,
  and unfederated.

  Data used to update internal entity information within each federated
  repository is distributed by being published at the source of an update
  and then republished by other repositories as they receive the update.
  Data used to manage the distribution of the data through the federation
  is published and republished as well.  All of the data published
  and republished in this fashion is referred to as "FederationTopic"
  data.  There are multiple FederationTopics, but when referred to as
  a FederationTopic, the reference should be applied to each actual DDS
  Topic individually.

  Each repository may be federated with one or more other repositories.
  It tracks all DataSamples that it receives by using a sequence number
  unique to each repository in the federation.  If it has not seen the
  request before, then it will republish the sample as well as process
  it internally.  If it has seen the sample before, then it will take no
  further action.  The sequence numbers generated by each repository are
  incremented in a "lollipop" fashion to allow the federated repositories
  to invalidate previous information if a repository with a given Id
  value is restarted.

  Repositories can be connected in an arbitrary fashion. The connectivity
  changes as repositories join and leave the federation, One of the
  FederationTopic topics includes link state information.  A link state
  manager associated with each Federator object then uses this information
  to develop a minimal spanning tree of the current topology each time
  an update is received.  This information can then be used to reduce
  subscriptions to the remaining FederationTopic data to only those on the
  minimal spanning tree.  This reduces to a minimum the amount of data
  passed through the mesh of connected repositories in order to update
  service entity information.  The link state information subscriptions
  can not be restricted by the topology since as connections appear and
  disappear from the topology the minimal spanning tree will be changed;
  meaning the link state data may need to traverse links not in the
  previous tree.

Implementation Details

  The following sections describe in more detail the interfaces and data
  required for the implementation of repository federation.

RepoUpdater interface

  An abstract repository update interface has been defined to localize
  the features required to synchronize the data within the federated
  repositories.  This interface has methods for each entity type to be
  updated as well as an ownership passing mechanism.  This interface
  needs to be implemented by the existing DCPSInfo objects in order
  for them to participate in federated repository operation.  It is also
  implemented by the Federator objects which allows the DCPSInfo objects
  to pass local updates to the federation.

  Update interfaces exist for Topic, DomainParticipant, Publication and
  Subscription service entities.  Parameters to these calls include the
  owner FederatedId value and an updated value.  The value type is unique
  to each update to be made.  Transport information and QoS policy values
  are updated along with the entities that they are associated with.
  Domains and domain associations with entities are carried with the
  individual entities being updated.

  Ownership is passed from one repository to another through a
  request/grant mechanism.  A repository that wishes to assert ownership
  over an entity (in order to update it) needs to make a request for
  ownership.  This is similar to a Read-For-Ownership operation in
  other synchronization strategies.  The request is propagated through
  the federated repositories until the current owner receives it.
  If a determination is made to relinquish ownership, a grant is made
  and propagated in a fashion similar to the request.  Ownership is
  considered passed as soon as the current owner issues the grant.

  Note that there are no race conditions since there can be only a
  single owner and that owner will process only one call at a time.
  If the first request is granted, any subsequent requests to that
  owner are invalidated, even if they are already propagating within the
  repositories.  If a request has been made and a grant relinquishing
  ownership to a different repository is seen, then the request needs
  to be reissued to the new owner.  While it is possible to imagine a
  pathological scenario where a particular repository is never granted
  ownership, any such scenario is unlikely in actual applications; it
  would require at least three different applications constantly making
  changes to a Topic or its description.

  The request and grant requests have parameters with the old owning
  repository FederatedId value, the new repository FederatedId value
  and a call sequence id from the repository issuing the request or
  grant.  It can be assumed by all repositories seeing (and possibly
  propagating) these calls that a requests new repository name is that
  of the originator of the request and that a grants old repository name
  is that of the originator of the grant.

Federator interface

  A repository federation interface has been defined to localize the
  features required to manage the federation process.  This interface
  contains methods to allow adding and removing external repositories
  from a federation as well as containing the local repository unique
  Id value and a mapping for all externally owned objects to local
  reference values.  A set of repository Id values for each repository
  that has an Id mapping in the current repository is kept as well in
  order to simplify adding and removing repositories from the federation.

  There are methods to allow adding a repository to the federation and
  removing a repository from the federation.  It is possible to remove a
  connection (or have a connection dropped) without losing connectivity
  to a repository since there may be redundant paths.  The ability to
  remove a connection only is also provided.  Since adding a connection
  to a repository will either add it to the federation or provide a
  redundant path to the repository, no separate remote method is required
  for adding a connection.  Processing will terminate after adding the
  connection if the repository is already a member of the federation.

  When adding a new repository to an already federated repository (a
  federation of one, for the first federation), the added repository
  calls the existing federated repository with the IORs of both the new
  repository and its Federator interface.  This allows the federated
  repository to add the new repository to its list of connections as well
  as subscribe to the new repository's FederationTopics.  Once the call
  to the federated repository has completed, the new repository then
  subscribes to the FederationTopics of the federation.

  Removing a repository from a federation may be performed cooperatively:
  where communications allow calls and data to be passed between the
  federated repositories and the repository(ies) being removed from
  the federation.  It may also be performed independently: where
  a communication link has failed and it is no longer possible to
  communicate between the federated repositories and one or more
  repositories that had previously been federated.  The processing
  performed in both these scenarios is identical.

  Note that there is only a difference of degree and not kind when
  removing a single repository or separating two topologically separate
  groups of repositories from federation.  The actions required by both
  parties are the same in both cases.  In the discussion that follows,
  the removal is spoken of as a single repository.  The operations and
  sequencing is the same if there were an island of connected
  repositories being removed.

  To remove a repository(ies) from a federation, calls are made to the
  Federator interfaces of the repositories attached to the federation.
  For each call the communication link is dropped.  This means that the
  subscribers on both sides of the association are deleted and the remote
  references between the two repositories are removed.  This will result
  in updated link state information flooding the federated repositories.

  When the last connection between the federated repositories and the
  repository being removed is detached, the link state manager will note
  that there are unreachable repositories in the topology.  This triggers
  the remainder of the removal operations.  All data in the federated
  repository which is owned by repositories that have become unreachable
  is removed.  Each repository in the federation will detect the same
  topology change. This allows suppression of updates for the removal
  of this data.

  Topic and TopicDescription entities which are owned by an unreachable
  repository are handled specially.  Since it is possible to have a Topic
  used by entities which are not in the same repository, they persist
  after the removal of the repository.  Ownership is passed automatically
  to the repository which was the last to have a connection to the now
  disconnected repository.  Note that when reconnecting to a repository,
  the ability to match Topic and TopicDescription entities and deduce
  ownership will be required.

DataWriter and DataReader interface extensions

  The DataWriterRemote and DataReaderRemote interfaces accessed by the
  repositories are extended to implement the repository federation
  as well.  They each have a method added that allows the Federator
  object of a repository to add mapping information to the application.
  This mapping information is necessary in order to generate the
  correct publication Id in the data sample headers being sent and to
  recognize the publication Id values in received data sample headers.
  The values that are in the headers are the FederatedId values, which
  need to be mapped to and from the internal repository id values used
  by the service transport implementations.

Repository objects

  Federated repositories extend the DCPSInfo servant into a
  FederatedRepo servant.  This is done to add the new RepoUpdate interface
  methods that are called by the Federator servant.  The Federator servant
  contains all logic required to allow multiple repositories to become
  federated.  In the absence of any external federated repositories, this
  object maintains mappings and pushes publication ids to the data writers
  and readers.  This means that only publications and subscriptions
  managed by this repository will be recognized.

  The Federator object maintains an internal mapping for all objects in
  the federated repositories, performing translations between the local
  repository Id values and the full FederatedId values.

Application objects

  The Service_Participant within any application has a mapping added for
  each repository which is attached to that Service_Participant.  The
  mapping contains reference information for all known publications
  within the federated repositories.  This is the information used to
  translate to and from the publication Id values in the data sample
  headers.  Since the internal repository Id values mapped are different
  for each repository, a separate map for each attached repository is
  required.

************************************************************************
*** Use Cases:

A) Repository starts operation

   This is essentially the previous mode of operation for the repository.
   In addition, the Federator::Manager object is incarnated and its IOR
   stored to the IORTable along with the DCPSInfoRepo interface IOR.

   *********************************************************************
   Scenario A.1) Standalone startup

   This scenario consists of a repository starting up and initializing
   its DCPSInfoRepo and Federator components so that federation can be
   supported by the executing process.

   *********************************************************************
   Scenario A.2) Startup and federate

   This scenario extends the previous one (A.1) by including the initial
   federation with another repository.  The federation information is
   provided on the command line and the federation process is the same as
   that described in use case (B).  The command line argument consists of
   an endpoint to reach the external repository to federate with.

B) Repository joins a federation of (one or more) other repositories

   This is the initial join operation where a repository receives
   federation information and provides its internal information back to
   the federation in return.  At the end of this processing, each
   repository of the federation will contain the same information in
   slightly different format.  Each repository will retain a mapping from
   the federation scope identification of service Entities to its own
   internal representation of these Entities.

   *********************************************************************
   Scenario B.1) Repository has no prior information from federation

   This is the initial federation operation, where a repository that has
   been operating standalone is given the endpoint of another repository
   with which to federate.  It finds the DCPSInfoRepo and Federator
   objects (in the IORTable) at that endpoint.

   The external repository provides updates for information that it
   contains and the federating repository provides its internal
   information to the external repository.

   *********************************************************************
   Scenario B.2) Repository has prior information from federation

   This is where a repository had participated in a federation of
   repositories, left the federation and in this scenario is rejoining
   the federation.  This includes validating that the residual
   information from the previous participation in the federation does not
   conflict with the current values.  It also includes updating new
   information that was added to the repository as well as internal to
   the federation while the repository was not participating in the
   federation.

   *********************************************************************
   Scenario B.3) Repository is already member of federation

   This is where an additional connection is added to a repository that
   is already participating in the federation.  No new information is
   exchanged when this connection is added.  The topology and possibly
   the minimal spanning tree used to distribute updates within the
   federation may be updated.  Sample numbers are used to prevent
   updating repository information more than once.

C) Repository removes a redundant connection

   This is where a connection between repositories in the federation is
   removed.  In this case, the connection is redundant in the sense that
   the repositories at the ends of the connection still have a path over
   which they can communicate, which means that the federation
   information does not change.  The topology and the mechanisms to
   transmit data updates will change according to the details of the
   connection that was removed.

   *********************************************************************
   Scenario C.1) Topology minimum spanning tree unaffected

   This scenario simply updates the topolgy information and removes
   the connection from internal tables.  No change to the federation
   information or its distribution is made.

   *********************************************************************
   Scenario C.2) Topology minumum spanning tree changed

   This scenario extends the previous one (C.1) and results in a
   change in the way updates are distributed within the federation.
   Subscriptions to update information is changed from the previosu
   minimum spanning tree links to the new ones.

D) Repository removes an irredundant connection

   This is where a connection between repositories in the federation is
   removed.  In this case, the connection is the only path between the
   repositories at its ends.  This results in the federation being split
   into two separate sub-federations, where each of these may contain one
   or more repositories of the original federation.  The federation
   information within each new, separate, federation is affected as well
   as changes to the topology.  Other than not being able to send updates
   to over the removed connection, update data is trasmitted over the
   same paths as before the connection was removed, since it was by
   definition on the minumum spanning tree and its removal will not
   affect the two sub-trees that are the minimal spanning trees of the
   resulting sub-federations.

   *********************************************************************
   Scenario D.1) Repository becomes isolated from entire federation

   This scenario is where a repository leaves a federation of
   repositories.  The connection is removed as in scenario (C.1).  Since
   the remaining repository federation will not have a change to the
   minimum spanning tree, no other distribution changes are required.
   The leaving repository will remove all internal references to service
   Entities _other_ _than_ _Topics_ that are owned by other repositories.
   The federation will remove references to all non-Topic Entity
   references owned by the leaving repository.

   *********************************************************************
   Scenario D.2) Repository becomes isolated from portion of federation

   This scenario is similar to the previous one (D.1) with the additional
   behavior that both new groups of repositories that remain connected
   are what is described for the remaining federated repositories in that
   scenario.

************************************************************************
*** Scenarios:

   *********************************************************************
   Scenario A.1) Standalone startup

   main():
   1) DCPSInfoRepo instantiated, activated and IOR bound to IORTable.

      [design: this is existing code]

   2) Federator::Manager instantiated, activated and IOR bound to IORTAble.

      a) Obtain federation Id value from command line

   *********************************************************************
   Scenario A.2) Startup and federate

   main():
   1) Initiate processing of scenario (A.1).

   2) Initiate processing of (B.1) using endpoint supplied from command
      line.

   *********************************************************************
   Scenario B.1) Repository has no prior information from federation

   Federator::Manager::join_federation( endpoint):
   1) resolve remote federator at corbaloc:iiop:endpoint/Federator

   2) call remote Federator::Manager federatorId() and generate a new
      <remote> domain value for this connection as its federation Id value

      [rationale: a separate domain is required in order to attach two
       separate repositories within the same Service_Participant.  This
       is an artifact of the way multiple repositories are handled within
       the Service_Participant]

   3) call remote Federator::Manager join_federation( endpoint)

      [rationale: this lets the federated repository add ourselves to
       its federation]

      [design: we need to mark ourselves as in process so that we can
       return immediately when we are called back from the remote side
       while still processing]

      [dependency: this can be done at any point between here and where
       we return.]

   4) resolve remote repository at corbaloc:iiop:endpoint/DCPSInfoRepo

   5) add remote repository to Service_Participant bound to <remote>
      domain

   6) add publication for update topics on <self> domain in
      "<self>-<remote>" partition with DURABILITY==TRANSIENT_LOCAL

   7) publish all internal Entities to new publication

      [caveat: this may need to be delayed if DURABILITY does not hold
       the data until a subscriber is associated]

      [note: the choice to examine the internal storage or create a
       separate storage for updates is yet to be made]

   8) add publication for LinkState data on <remote> domain in
      "<self>-<remote>" partition

   9) publish (<self>,<remote>,ON,<sequence>) on all link state
      publications in federator

  10) subscribe to LinkState data on <remote> domain in "<remote>-<self>"
      partition

      [rationale: separate partitions are required in order to allow
       different physical links or otherwise restricted connections to be
       used within the same domains]

  11) on_data_available( LinkState): update topology and determine new
      minimum spanning tree

      a) for each link removed from MST, unsubscribe from update topics
         on that domain

      b) for each link added to MST, subscribe to update topics on
         that domain

      c) for each repository that becomes unreachable, remove all
         references to non-Topic Entities from that repository

         [rationale: the Topic Entity references are left intact since
          they may still be in use]

         [design: calling delete on the publication and subscription
          entities should result in the remove_associations being
          forwarded to the Service_Participants involved]

  12) on_data_available( Udpate*):

      a) Find the set of <remote> repositories on the MST that does not
         include the source of this sample and forward the sample to them

      b) If this is an update for a new (to this repository) Entity:

         i) Create new entity and obtain its <localId>

        ii) Add mapping from (<remote>,<id>) to <localId>

       iii) If the mapping is for a publication, call the
            DataReaderRemote and DataWriterRemote add_mapping() method
            on attached readers and writers

            [design: this is simpler than adding an IDL interface to
             each participant and calling just once per participant.
             It is only necessary to add the mapping to each distinct
             Service_Participant that is attached to the repository]

      c) If this is an update for an existing Entity:

         i) obtain <localId> for (<remote>,<id>) value

        ii) update data for <localId>

   *********************************************************************
   Scenario B.2) Repository has prior information from federation

   The processing for this scenario is identical to that of the previous
   (B.1) scenario.  The difference is that when receiving data updates
   for Topics, they will be handled as existing entities.  The update
   processing for Topic data will therefore need to ensure validity of
   the update.

   *********************************************************************
   Scenario B.3) Repository is already member of federation

   The processing for this scenario is identical to the earlier (B.1)
   scenario.  The difference is that no additional update topic data
   will be distributed.  If some historical data is distributed, then it
   will be ignored since it will already have been received and
   processed.

   *********************************************************************
   Scenario C.1) Topology minimum spanning tree unaffected

   Federator::Manager::remove_connection( remote):
   1) delete subscriptions to update and link state topics in <remote>
      domain

   2) delete publications of update and link state topics in <self>
      domain, "<self>-<remote>" partition

   3) publish (<self>,<remote>,OFF,<sequence>) on all link state
      publications in federator

   *********************************************************************
   Scenario C.2) Topology minumum spanning tree changed

   The processing for this scenario is identical to that of the previous
   (C.1) scenario.  The difference is that the MST change will be
   detected and processed as described in scenario (B.1) step 11.  This

   The processing for this scenario is identical to that of the previous
   (C.1) scenario.  The difference is that the MST change will be
   detected and processed as described in scenario (B.1) step 11.  This
   is where the LinkState topic listener processing is described.  As
   repositories become isolated, references to their owned entities are
   removed from the repositories that can no longer reach the isolated
   repository
