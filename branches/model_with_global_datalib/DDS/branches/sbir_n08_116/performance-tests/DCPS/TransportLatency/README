This test is set up for measuring the performance on the
Transport Frame only, i.e., we don't care the concrete
transport implementation (e.g. TCP) in this test.

For more detailed discussion, please refer to RT 11129.

To run the test:
./run_test.pl -n <number of messages> // default is 10

To enable some debug message in the testing library
./run_test.pl -debug -n <number of messages>
