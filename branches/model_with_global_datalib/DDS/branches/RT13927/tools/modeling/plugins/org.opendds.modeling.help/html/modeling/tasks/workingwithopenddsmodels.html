  <h2>Working with OpenDDS Models</h2>

  <h3>The OpenDDS Model</h3>The OpenDDS Model consists of
  "libraries" of possibly re-usable OpenDDS elements and optionally
  Packages that can contain these libraries.

  <div id="note">
    <p>Library in this context is different than the concept of C++
    object file libraries used in OpenDDS. Even though you may be
    working with different modeling libraries the generated code
    will target a single object file library.</p>
  </div>

  <h3>Creating a Model</h3>

  <p>To create an OpenDDS SDK model, from the <a href=
  'javascript:executeCommand("org.eclipse.ui.newWizard")'><b>Eclipse
  File -&gt; New</b></a> -&gt; Other... (Ctrl+N) menu item select
  OpenDDS Diagram under the OpenDDS Models category as shown in the
  figure below.</p><img alt="Creating new OpenDDS diagram" src=
  "../images/new_diagram_selection.png">

  <p>The Create OpenDDS Diagram wizard when then prompt for the
  name of the diagram file and the name of the file containing
  domain model itself. It is recommended that when specifying the
  model file name you use the default which has the same base name
  as the diagram file.</p>

  <div id="note">
    <p>Many diagram-based modeling tools keep both the model and
    diagram elements in a single file. In the case of the OpenDDS
    SDK these files are kept separate. This will readily allow for
    alternative representations of the model that coexist with
    diagrams to be considered.</p>
  </div><br>

  <div id="caution">
    <p>After selecting the name of the diagram file, make sure you
    select the Next button instead of Finish. Under certain
    conditions the base portion of default name for the model file
    will not match the base portion of the diagram file if this
    step is skipped.</p>
  </div>

  <h3>Populating the Model</h3>

  <p>After the selection of a new OpenDDS Diagram you will then be
  presented with an editor that consists of a canvas and a palette
  of "libraries" that can dragged onto the canvas. An example of
  this editor is shown in the following figure.</p><img alt=
  "Creating new OpenDDS diagram" src=
  "../images/new_diagram_editor.png">

  <p>You can open a library that is on the canvas by first
  selecting it and then double-clicking on it or pressing the Enter
  key. You can verify it is selected when you see a thick border
  around the figure with re-sizing handles on it as shown
  below.</p><img alt="Selected library" src=
  "../images/main_diagram_selected_lib.png">

  <p>When you open up a library there will be a new editor window
  in your editor window. See <a href=
  "workingwithdiagrams.html#moving_between_diagrams">Moving between
  Diagrams</a> for information on working with multiple diagram
  editors.</p>

  <h3>Using Packages</h3>

  <p>Although you can partition libraries by placing them in
  separate model files, packages provides a way to organize
  libraries within the same model file. Packages can be
  hierarchical and can contain libraries or other
  packages:</p><img alt="Packages" src=
  "../images/main_diagram_packages.png">

  <p>When generating C++ code, packages will map to namespaces.</p>

  <div id="note">
    <p>If you have numerous nested packages you may want to review
    <a href="workingwithdiagrams.html#arranging_figures">arranging
    figures</a> on how to automatically resize and reposition your
    packages and package contents so they don't overlap.</p>
  </div>

  <h3>Validation of Libraries and Packages</h3>

  <p>Before using your model to for code generation you should
  perform validations first. See <a href=
  "performingvalidations.html">Performing Validations</a> to learn
  how to do validations.</p>
