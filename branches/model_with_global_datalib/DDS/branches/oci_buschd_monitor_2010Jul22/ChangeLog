        * tools/odds_monitor/TreeNode.h:

          Changed QList<>::removeOne() to QList<>::removeAll() to allow
          use with earlier Qt 4.3 version.

          Fixed nightly build compile errors.

        * dds/DCPS/Definitions.h:

          Fixed nightly build warning. LONG_MAX and LONG_MIN
          are actually the unsigned long max and min for
          linux.

Wed Jul 14 20:56:38 UTC 2010  Brian Johnson  <johnsonb@ociweb.com>

        * dds/DCPS/Definitions.h:

          Changed to use ACE_INT32.  Made SequenceNumber a class
          and provided accessors to value_.  Also made a typedef
          for ACE_INT32 to use when a SequenceNumber value is not
          being stored in a SequenceNumber.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/multicast/MulticastTypes.h:

          Int16 to Int32 changes and removal of functions.

Wed Jul 14 18:21:35 UTC 2010  Yan Dai  <dai_y@ociweb.com>

        * dds/DCPS/DisjointSequence.h:
        * dds/DCPS/DisjointSequence.cpp:

          Added a dump() method to help debugging.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/multicast/MulticastConfiguration.h:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/multicast/MulticastConfiguration.cpp:

          Added nak_delay_intervals configuration parameter to define the
          number of intervals between naks after the initial nak.  This
          makes the initial nak sent right away and resend after delayed
          intervals. This could reduce naks.

          Added nak_max configuration parameter to limit the maximum number
          of times a missing sample will be nak'ed for.  Set this parameter
          so the nak will be not be sent repeatedly for the unrecoverable
          packets.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/multicast/ReliableSession.h:

          Changed NakRequestMap from multimap to map as the key is
          always unique.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/multicast/ReliableSession.cpp:

          Changed expire_naks() to remove looping through nak requests,
          to shift the sequence baseline instead of resetting it, and
          to make time out message clearer.

          Changed send_naks() to use new configuration parameters
          nak_delay_intervals and nak_max.  Missing samples will now be
          nak'ed for on the first nak_interval and then after every
          nak_delay_intervals until the missing sample has been nak'ed
          for nak_max times or the nak_timeout has expired.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/multicast/multicast.ini-dist:

          Added new configurations.

        * dds/idl/CPPTemplate.txt:

          Excluded disposal and unregister messages from check for
          max samples as this was causing these messages to be lost.

Tue Jul 13 14:25:56 UTC 2010  Brian Johnson  <johnson_b@ociweb.com>

        * dds/DCPS/DisjointSequence.cpp:

          Fix for broken nightly build.

Mon Jul 12 20:54:17 UTC 2010  Brian Johnson  <johnsonb@ociweb.com>

        * dds/DCPS/Definitions.h:

          Change operator< to double the distance and compare this with
          the range of valid positive values so that < would never be ambiguious,
          since the distance will always be even and range is odd.  Error was
          exposed by UnitTests/SequenceNumber.cpp lines 38 and 42.

        * dds/DCPS/DisjointSequence.h:
        * dds/DCPS/DisjointSequence.inl:
        * dds/DCPS/DisjointSequence.cpp:

          Added private function to determine what the previous sequence
          number should be.  Error was exposed by
          UnitTest/DisjointSequence.cpp lines 213-223.

        * tests/DCPS/UnitTests/DisjointSequence.cpp:

          Added tests to expose errors in DisjointSequence logic.

        * tests/DCPS/UnitTests/SequenceNumber.cpp:
        * tests/DCPS/UnitTests/UnitTests.mpc:

          Added SequenceNumber tests.

        * dds/DCPS/DataReaderImpl.cpp:
        * dds/DCPS/SubscriberImpl.cpp:
        * dds/idl/CPPTemplate.txt:

          Corrected the behave when subscriber has INSTANCE or TOPIC
          presentation qos and publisher has GROUP presentation qos.

        * dds/DCPS/DomainParticipantImpl.cpp:

          Added check for nil bit_pub_dr_ in ownership_manager().
          This prevents crash when builtin topic is turned off in a non
          minimum bit build.

        * tests/DCPS/GroupPresentation/DataReaderListener.cpp:

          The same change is needed for idl2jni to work with the

        * dds/idl/be_util.cpp:

          class with static methods.

        * dds/idl/be_global.cpp:
        * dds/idl/be_global.h:

          Moved methods not related to

Fri Jul  9 20:14:17 UTC 2010  Yan Dai  <dai_y@ociweb.com>

        * dds/DCPS/OwnershipManager.cpp:

          Fixed a bug that adds same writer to ownership candidate
          list multiple times when its strength is changed to be greater
          than current owner. This was observed from subscriber log in
          ownership update_strength test.

        * tests/DCPS/Ownership/Writer.cpp:

          Add one second delay before reset the writer strength to be higher,
          so the builtin topic data update arrives only after samples with
          previous strength on subscriber side. This helps simplify result
          verification on subscriber side.

Tue Jul  6 18:20:11 UTC 2010  Yan Dai  <dai_y@ociweb.com>

        * tests/DCPS/Ownership/Writer.cpp:

        * dds/DCPS/DataReaderImpl.h:
        * dds/DCPS/DataReaderImpl.cpp:

          Added a map to WriterInfo to keep track whether ownership need
          be evaluated for each instance. Previously, it used single flag
          for all instances sent by the writer. This is the bug that cause
          only samples belong the first instance were received when higher
          strength writer took ownership and published multiple instances.

        * dds/DCPS/DomainParticipantImpl.cpp:

          Fixed a deadlock issue that caused by reverse locking between
          DomainParticipantImpl subscribers_protector_ and ReceiveListenerSet
          lock_. This happened when one thread deleting subscriber from
          delete_contained_entities() while the reactor thread delievered
          builtin topic data sample and called BitPubListenerImpl to update
          ownership strength.

        * dds/DCPS/OwnershipManager.h:

          This would fix pure function called error on linux due

Fri Jun 25 18:36:19 UTC 2010  Yan Dai  <dai_y@ociweb.com>

        * bin/dcps_tests.lst:

          Fixed a memory corruption due to a possibility to

Mon Jun 21 17:47:44 UTC 2010  Adam Mitz  <mitza@ociweb.com>

        * Merged the branch "sbir_n08_116", which includes changes for spec
          compliance.  See docs/history/ChangeLog-sbir_n08_116 for details.
          Major features added are:

          - Content-Subscription Profile: implemented ContentFilteredTopic and
            the remaining functionality for QueryCondition
          - QoS: OWNERSHIP; PRESENTATION (access_scope = GROUP)

          The Content-Subscription Profile implementation required a change to
          OpenDDS's strategy for code-generation.  OpenDDS-specific code has
          been moved out of tao_idl's back-end library (enabled with -Gdcps)
          and into a code generator here in the OpenDDS repository, called
          opendds_idl (in dds/idl).  Existing applications that use MPC should
          only need to change one of the arguments which may appear in
          dcps_ts_flags: '--export=' has become '-Wb,export_macro='.
          Also, note that for footprint-sensitive applications, the content-
          subscription profile can be disabled at compile-time by setting the
          MPC feature content_subscription=0.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/udp/UdpTransport.cpp:

          Supported same transport pub-sub associations (see RT13902).
          - Added is_loopback and is_active flag to Datalink to help identify
            the active(pub) end or passive(sub) end.
          - For SimpleTCP, the links to same remote are seperated for active
            and passive side.
          - UDP was not changed as it's already seperated with the active
            and passive links.
          - Multicast transport creates two links (one link is for pubs and
            one is for subs) instead of single link per transport. As before,
            each link could have multiple sessions.
