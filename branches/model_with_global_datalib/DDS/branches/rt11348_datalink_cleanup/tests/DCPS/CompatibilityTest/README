A basic liveliness timeout test of DDS.

run_test.pl
  Run a separate publisher and subscriber process.

This test is to verify RT#12036.
This test will stop working once RT#12054 is fixed.(the test exploits the fact that we don't require the publisher liveliness to be less than the subscriber liveliness)
