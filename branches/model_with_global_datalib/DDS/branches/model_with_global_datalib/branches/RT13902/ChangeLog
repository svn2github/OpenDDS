        * java/build_scripts/JavaTypeSupportImpl.pm:

          Fixed a bug that generates incorrect jni class name when the
          module name contains underscore and causes UnsatisfiedLinkError.
          The "_1" needs be used to replace the underscore.

        * java/tests/complex_idl/Complex.idl:

          Renamed Complex.idl to Complex_Idl.idl file and changed
          module name from Complex to Complex_Idl to verify the bug fix.

        * java/idl2jni/codegen/im_java.cpp:

          For IDL unions without an explicit default that need a generated
          default (because the branches don't cover all possible discriminator
          values), if the discriminator type is an enum we need to wrap the
          primitive (int) value of the enum in the Java object for the enum.

        * performance-tests/Bench/tests/thru/pub-*-*.ini:
        * performance-tests/Bench/tests/thru/sub-*.ini:

          New set of tests for publication bound and subscription bound
          throughput testing.

        * performance-tests/Bench/tests/thru/test-commands.txt:

          Added documentation of new publication bound and subscription
          bound tests.

        * java/build_scripts/jms_scoreboard.pl:

          If ant returns non-zero and at least one test has failed,
          don't output an additional line that will be flagged as an error
          by the scoreboard parser.

        * MPC/config/dcps_monitor.mpb:
        * tools/odds_monitor/Monitor.mpc:

          Added a new base project for including the monitor library.
          Thanks to Adam Mitz for helping me understand Johnny's original
          suggestion.

        * tools/odds_monitor/Monitor.mpc:

          Make the project build after the OpenDDS_monitor project it
          depends on.  Thanks to Johnny Willemsen for this correction.

        * dds/DCPS/DomainParticipantFactoryImpl.cpp:
          Initialise a pointer with 0

        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/TransportSendStrategy.cpp:
          Fix invalid logging mask

        * performance-tests/Bench/bin/run_test:

          Debugged statistics collecting.

        * performance-tests/Bench/tests/thru/test-commands.txt:

          Added statistics gathering argument to p2 command lines.

        * performance-tests/Bench/bin/run_test:

          Added script PID to system statistics output file.  This will
          allow statistics to be gathered in a loopback test without
          conflicts.
          Corrected a documentation issue.

        * performance-tests/Bench/tests/thru/p1-be-*.ini:

          Updated Topics to be BEST_EFFORT.  This was preventing
          associations on the return trip from being made.

        * java/idl2jni/codegen/idl2jni_visitor.h:
        * java/idl2jni/codegen/idl2jni_visitor.cpp:

          Updated ast_visitor interface for upcoming DOC x.7.7 release.

        * performance-tests/Bench/tools/mkpkg:

          Use correct configuration file source for package.

Mon Feb  8 15:10:54 UTC 2010  Mike Martinez  <martinez_m@ociweb.com>

        * performance-tests/Bench/bin/run_test:

          Correct a syntax error.

        * performance-tests/Bench/tools/mkpkg:

          Add the new througput test configuration files to the built
          package.  Added a note about versions on the transport library
          link establishment as well.

Sat Feb  6 00:01:39 UTC 2010  Mike Martinez  <martinez_m@ociweb.com>

        * performance-tests/Bench/bin/run_test:

          Added new '-C' option to indicate that process and system
          statistics should be collected.  System statistics are gathered
          using a single 'vmstat' command during the test, while process
          statistics are gathered for each sub-process using a batch
          'top' command.  This is useful only on *nix derived platforms
          and so is restricted to them.

        * performance-tests/Bench/src/Publication.cpp:

          Hoisted sample stack allocation out of sending loop.  Invariant
          sample sizes will no longer result in byte sequence needing to
          be extended for each sample.

        * performance-tests/Bench/src/Subscription.cpp:

          Added count summary output regardless of statistics collection
          to remove a need to calculate statistics to count samples.

        * performance-tests/Bench/tests/latency/test-commands.txt:

          Added '.txt' extension for convenience.

        * performance-tests/Bench/tests/thru:

          Added new pre-configured test.  This includes 13 conditions
          covering the message size/ message rate space to send from
          76 Mibps (100Mbps) through 1907 Mibps (2500Mbps) of data
          through the test path.
