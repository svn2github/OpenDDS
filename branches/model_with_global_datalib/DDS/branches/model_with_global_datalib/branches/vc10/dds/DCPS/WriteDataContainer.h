/**
 * @class WriteDataContainer
 *
 * @brief A container for instances sample data.
 *
 * This container is instantiated per DataWriter. It maintains
 * list of PublicationInstance objects which is internally
 * referenced by the instance handle.
 *
 * This container contains threaded lists of all data written to a
 * given DataWriter. The real data sample is represented by the
 * DataSampleListElement.  The data_holder_ holds all
 * DataSampleListElement in the writing order via the
 * next_sample_/previous_sample_ thread. The instance list in
 * PublicationInstance links samples via the next_instance_sample_
 * thread.
 *
 * There are four state transition lists - unsent, sending, sent
 * and released during the data writing. These lists are linked
 * via the next_send_sample_/previous_send_sample_ thread. Any
 * DataSampleListElement should be in one of these four lists and
 * SHOULD NOT be shared between these four lists. A normal
 * transition of a DataSampleListElement would be
 * unsent->sending->sent, but a DataSampleListElement could be
 * moved from sending to released list when the instance reaches
 * maximum samples allowed and the transport is still using the
 * sample. A DataSampleListElement is removed from released or
 * sent list after it's delivered or dropped and is freed when
 * it's removed from release list or when the instance queue needs
 * more space.  The real data sample will be freed when the
 * reference counting goes 0.  The resend list is only used when
 * the datawriter uses TRANSIENT_LOCAL_DURABILITY_QOS. It holds
 * the DataSampleElements for the data sample duplicates of the
 * sending and sent list and are pushed to the released list after
 * giving to the transport.
 *
 *
 *
 * @note: 1) The PublicationInstance object is not removed from
 *           this container until the instance is
 *           unregistered. The same instance handle is reused for
 *           re-registration. The instance data is deleted when
 *           this container is deleted. This would simplify
 *           instance data memory management. An alternative way
 *           is to remove the handle from the instance list when
 *           unregister occurs and delete the instance data after
 *           the transport is done with the instance, but we do
 *           not have a way to know when the transport is done
 *           since we have the sending list for all instances in
 *           the same datawriter.
 *        2) This container has the ownership of the instance data
 *           samples when the data is written. The type-specific
 *           datawriter that allocates the memory for the sample
 *           data gives the ownership to its base class.
 *        3) It is the responsibility of the owner of objects of
 *           this class to ensure that access to the lists are
 *           properly locked.  This means using the same
 *           lock/condition to access the lists via the enqueue(),
 *           get*(), and data_delivered() methods.  For the case
 *           where these are all called from the same (client)
 *           thread, this should be a recursive lock so that: 1)
 *           we do not deadlock; and, 2) we incur the cost of
 *           obtaining the lock only once.
