BUILDING DDS
========================

* Supported platform:

  We have built DDS examples on Win32 using MSVC 2003 .NET and gcc on 
  Linux and Solaris.

* Compiling:

    DDS requires the PortableServer orbsvcs and dependent libraries to build.

  1 Build ACE and TAO.

    Don't forget to build the PortableServer library.

  2 Set the environment variables.

    Set DDS_ROOT to the location of the DDS checkout.  The default
    value for DDS_ROOT is $TAO_ROOT/DDS

    Add $DDS_ROOT/bin to the PATH

    Add $DDS_ROOT/lib to the LD_LIBRARY_PATH (or %DDS_ROOT%\lib to
    the PATH for windows)

    Make sure that MPC_ROOT is defined.

  3 Generate the makefiles.

    DDS uses MPC for generating makefiles.

     On linux or Solaris:
      cd $DDS_ROOT
      perl $ACE_ROOT/bin/mwc.pl DDS.mwc

     On Windows:
      cd %DDS_ROOT%
      perl %ACE_ROOT%\bin\mwc.pl -type [InsertCompilerType] DDS.mwc


  4 Build

    On linux or Solaris:
    make

    On Windows:
    load the DDS solution (or workspace) into the compiler and
    build all.
