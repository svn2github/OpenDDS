To create new HTML documentation, copy the 'template' directory,
to a new directory named with the documents content:

  > svn copy template target

Follow the directions on the initial page labeled "Getting Started".

To publish static HTML pages, follow the instructions on the "Getting
Started" page.  A static HTML page for each published tiddler will be
created in a 'publish' subdirectory.  You will need to ensure that
relative paths (such as those in the "StyleSheet" tiddler) are correct
for the final target location of the HTML pages.
