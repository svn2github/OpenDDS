Functional test of zero-copy reads.

Both publication and subscription work in the main thread
to simplify the coordination of writes and reads.




It needs to launch DCPSInfoRepo:

  ../../../../DDS/DCPSInfoRepo -o repo.ior -d domain_ids


Command line option:

    // options:
    //  -n max_samples_per_instance defaults to INFINITE
    //  -d history.depth            defaults to 1
    //  -z                          verbose transport debug


!!! do not use -d because the test depends upon a value of 1
