Additional instructions for building OpenDDS with TAO 1.4a
==========================================================

See $DDS_ROOT/docs/INSTALL for general build instructions.

This note only applies if you have obtained a released verison of OpenDDS.  If
you have obtained OpenDDS from subversion, the rest of this file doesn't apply
to you.

The release includes an extra archive file at the top level ($DDS_ROOT) named
TAO_14a_projects.tar.gz (Unix line endings) or TAO_14a_projects.zip (Windows
line endings).  This archive contains separate copies of all of the
GNUmakefile* and *.vcproj, *.sln files.  Extract this archive to $DDS_ROOT
before proceeding to build.  This will replace all of the makefiles and project
files with 1.4a-compatible versions.
