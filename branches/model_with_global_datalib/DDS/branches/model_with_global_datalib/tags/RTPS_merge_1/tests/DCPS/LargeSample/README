This test confirms the fix on 
"Sun Jul 25 22:57:17 UTC 2010  Yan Dai  <dai_y@ociweb.com>".

This test based on Messenger test and changed sample to have > 65K bytes.
This test should succeed for SimpleTCP for now and fail on UDP and Multicast
as currently the UDP based fragmentation and reassembly is not supported. 

The udp and multicast test can be used in future when the UDP based 
fragmentation and reassembly are implemented.
