     * @brief Base class to hold configuration settings for TransportImpls.
     *
     * Each transport implementation will need to define a concrete
     * subclass of the TransportConfiguration class.  The base
     * class (TransportConfiguration) contains configuration settings that
     * are common to all (or most) concrete transport implementations.
     * The concrete transport implementation defines any configuration
     * settings that it requires within its concrete subclass of this
     * TransportConfiguration base class.
     *
     * The TransportConfiguration object is supplied to the
     * TransportImpl::configure() method.
