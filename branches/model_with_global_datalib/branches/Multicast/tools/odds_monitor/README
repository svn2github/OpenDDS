DIRECTORIES:

doc/
  -- Contains documentation related to this application.

images/
  -- Contains image resources used by this application.

FILES:

Monitor.ui
  -- Qt4 designer file specifying the UI for the application.

Monitor.qrc
  -- Resource specification file, managed by Qt4 designer.

Monitor.mpc
  -- MPC project file for the application.

*.{h,cpp}
  -- source code for application.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Code notes:

The GUI source code files are compiled by the Qt meta-object compiler and
have certain macros and other non-standard language constructs that are
parsed by that system.

This means that it is not recommended to run a style utility on the GUI
files, as the Qt specific elements may no longer be recognizable by the
Qt tools.

Currently the GUI files that should not be reformatted include:
  all generated files
  Monitor_main.cpp
  MonitorDataModel.{h,cpp}
  TreeNode.h
  Viewer.{h,cpp}

System notes:

You will need to set the environment for the standard ACE+TAO+DDS
settings.  Additionally, the following needs to be set:

> export QTDIR=/usr

If you are using a distribution version of Qt (such as the libqt4-dev
package for the Debian and Ubuntu distributions), then you will need to
set the environment to use a non-relative include directory for the Qt4
files:

> export QT4_INCDIR=/usr/include/qt4
