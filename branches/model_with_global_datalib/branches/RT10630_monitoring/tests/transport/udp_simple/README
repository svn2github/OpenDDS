(1) Launch the simple_subscriber:

  simple_subscriber -p 1:localhost:5555 -s 2:localhost:6666


(2) Launch the simple_publisher:

  simple_publisher -p 1:localhost:5555 -s 2:localhost:6666


This test is also an example of statically loading the SimpleUdp.

 - The udp.conf has static directive.

   static DCPS_SimpleUdpLoader "-type SimpleUdp"
 
 - The mpc file needs specify the dependency on SimpleUdp library.  
 - The test code may need 
    
    #include "dds/DCPS/transport/simpleUDP/SimpleUdp.h"
 
    This would make sure Initializer is created before the Service 
    Configurator open service configure file. The Initializer register
    the SimpleUdpLoad service with service configurator.
