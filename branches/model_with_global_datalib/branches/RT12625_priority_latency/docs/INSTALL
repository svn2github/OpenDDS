If you're building OpenDDS for use by Java applications, please see the file
java/INSTALL instead of this one.

BUILDING OpenDDS
========================

* Supported platform:

  We have built OpenDDS on Win32 using Visual Studio .NET 2003 (VC 7.1)
  and Visual Studio 2005 (VC 8), as well as gcc 3.3 on Solaris/x86, and gcc 3.4
  and 4.x on Linux. (See $DDS_ROOT/README for a more complete description)

* Compiling:

    DDS requires the TAO PortableServer and dependent libraries to build.  It
    is preferable to have a complete build of TAO's core (every library under
    $TAO_ROOT/tao) before attempting to build DDS.

  1 Build ACE and TAO.

    See the instructions in ACE_wrappers/ACE-INSTALL.html and
    ACE_wrappers/TAO/TAO-INSTALL.html or the relevant sections
    in OCI's TAO Developer's Guide.

    If you are using TAO 1.4a, see $DDS_ROOT/14a_README for more information.

  2 Set the environment variables.

    Set DDS_ROOT to the location of the DDS checkout.

    Add $DDS_ROOT/bin to the PATH (on, Windows add %DDS_ROOT%\bin)

    Add $DDS_ROOT/lib to the LD_LIBRARY_PATH (or %DDS_ROOT%\lib to
    the PATH for Windows)

    Make sure that the other normal ACE/TAO environment
    variables are defined.

  4 Build

    On Linux or Solaris:
    make
    (on Solaris be sure this is GNU make, possibly using "gmake")

    On Windows:
    Load the solution of your choice into Visual Studio and build all.  There
    are four solutions to select from:
        DDS.sln - VC71, DLLs
        DDS_Static.sln - VC71, Static libs
        DDS_vc8.sln - VC8, DLLs
        DDS_Static_vc8.sln - VC8, Static libs
    (Do not up-convert a VC71 solution/project into VC8)

  5 Test

    $DDS_ROOT/bin/auto_run_tests.pl

* Note:

 These instructions assume you have obtained OpenDDS as a released version from
 the website.  If you have obtained OpenDDS from subversion, you will need to
 generate makefiles or Visual Studio project files first.
 Make sure your environment variables are set, including MPC_ROOT.

     On Linux or Solaris:
      cd $DDS_ROOT
      perl $ACE_ROOT/bin/mwc.pl -type gnuace DDS.mwc

     On Windows:
      cd %DDS_ROOT%
      perl %ACE_ROOT%\bin\mwc.pl -type [CompilerType] DDS.mwc
        "CompilerTypes" tested include vc71, vc8, vc9, and nmake

* Platform specific notes:

 QNX:
  QNX requires the MPC feature "link_codecfactory=1" be present during makefile
  generation for both TAO and OpenDDS.  Technically, this is part of Step #1
  above because it's required in order to have a functioning TAO build.  Use
  the instructions under "Note:" above to re-generate the makefiles after
  adding the line "link_codecfactory=1" to the end of
  $ACE_ROOT/bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/default.features.
