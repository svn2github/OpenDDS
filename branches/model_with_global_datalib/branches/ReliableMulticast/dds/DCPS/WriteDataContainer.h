    /**
    * @class DataWriterImpl
    *
    * @brief A container for instances sample data.
    *
    * This container will be instantiated per DataWriter. It maintains
    * list of PublicationInstance objects which is internally referenced
    * by the instance handle.
    *
    * Each PublicationInstance object contains the marshaled data samples
    * for the instance, along with additional information for the instance,
    * that is to be transmitted to the subscriptions.
    *
    * This container contains threaded lists of all data written to a given
    * DataWriter.  Individual instances have their data accessed via a specific
    * instance thread.  This allows the list elements for a particular instance
    * to be managed individually.
    *
    * @note: 1)The PublicationInstance object is not removed from this container
    *          when the instance is unregistered. The same instance handle is
    *          reused for re-registration. The instance data is deleted when this
    *          container is deleted. This would simplify instance data memory
    *          management. An alternative way is to remove the handle from the
    *          instance list when unregister occurs and delete the instance data
    *          after the transport is done with the instance, but we do not have
    *          a way to know when the transport is done since we have the sending
    *          list for all instances in the same datawriter.
    *        2)This container has the ownership of the instance data samples
    *          when the data is written. The type-specific datawriter that
    *          allocates the memory for the sample data gives the ownership
    *          to its base class.
    *        3)It is the responsibility of the owner of objects of this class
    *          to ensure that access to the lists are properly locked.  This
    *          means using the same lock/condition to access the lists via the
    *          enqueue(), get*(), and data_delivered() methods.  For the case
    *          where these are all called from the same (client) thread, this
    *          should be a recursive lock so that: 1) we do not deadlock; and,
    *          2) we incur the cost of obtaining the lock only once.
