  <h2>Performing Validations</h2>

  <p>Validation checks can be performed on your modeling elements
  to help ensure that they are semantically correct and suitable to
  use as a basis for automatically generated code.</p>

  <p>To validate the modeling elements shown in a diagram, select
  the menu item <b>Edit -&gt; Validate</b>.</p>

  <p>Where feasible, individual elements will be decorated with a
  small icon if there is an error or warning associated with that
  element. The following figure shows the yellow warning decoration
  on the left figure and the red error decoration on the right
  figure</p>. <img alt="Validation decorated figures" src=
  "../images/validation_decorated_figures.png">

  <p>An error indicates that there is a semantic problem with the
  model that would result in code generation problems. A warning
  indicates a modeling construct may not be complete and in some
  cases could be ignored.</p>

  <p>If you hover your mouse over an error or warning icon a pop-up
  will show the validation failures for that element.</p>

  <p>Validation failures can also be seen in the Problems view as
  shown in the figure below. To bring up the Problems view select
  menu item <a href=
  'javascript:executeCommand("org.eclipse.ui.views.showView")'><b>Window
  -&gt; Show View</b></a> <b>-&gt; Problems</b></p><img alt=
