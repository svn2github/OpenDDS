(1) Launch the simple_subscriber:

  simple_subscriber -p 1:224.0.0.1:5555 -s 2:localhost:6666


(2) Launch the simple_publisher:

  simple_publisher -p 1:224.0.0.1:5555 -s 2:localhost


This test is also an example of statically loading the SimpleMcast.

 - The mcast.conf has static directive.

   static DCPS_SimpleMcastLoader "-type SimpleMcast"
 
 - The mpc file needs specify the dependency on SimpleMcast library.  
 - The test code may need 
    
    #include "dds/DCPS/transport/simpleMCAST/SimpleMcast.h"
 
    This would make sure Initializer is created before the Service 
    Configurator open service configure file. The Initializer register
    the SimpleMcastLoad service with service configurator.
