This test verifies that the DEADLINE QoS policy support in OpenDDS is
functioning properly.  It does so by performing the following actions:

1. Intentionally attempting to set incompatible offered and requested
   deadline periods.  The offered deadline period must be less than or
   equal to the requested deadline period.

2. Creating DataReaders and DataWriters with and without listeners,
   where the requested and offered deadlines are compatibly
   configured.

3. Attempts to detect that missed deadlines are reported regularly,
   according to the configured deadline periods.  No data is sent at
   this point.

4. Send data at a rate that purposely prevents deadlines from being
   missed.
