The DDS 1.2 specification (formal/07-01-01) adds additional operations which
affect the scope and use of instance handles.  Instance handles are now
made available via the Entity::get_instance_handle operation.  It is also
possible for a given DomainParticipant to assert whether or not it contains
a given entity through the use of contains_entity operation.  Currently,
instance handles are either derived from an associated RepoId assigned by the
DCPSInfoRepo or generated as a sequence.  Due to the increased scope and wider
use presented in the updated specification, a new generation scheme is
required.

Instance handles will now be divided into two categories:
- Entity instance handles
- Data instance handles

Entity instance handles are assigned to both local and remote entities
by the DomainParticipantImpl.  At the time an entity instance handle is
created, a corresonding RepoId must be available and associated for remote
entities.  These RepoIds are used when calling the DCPSInfoRepo for the
various ignore_* operations.

When a new entity instance handle is created for a remote entity, the
DomainParticipantImpl should verify that the given RepoId has not already
been associated.  If it has, the previously assigned instance handle should
be used.  If it has not, a new instance handle should be generated and
associated with the given RepoId in a map managed by the DomainParticipantImpl.

Per the specification, the contains_entity operation may recurse through a 
DomainParticipant's Subscriber and Publisher.

Entity instance handles should have their state periodically purged when
entities are either deleted or disassociated.  

Data instance handles are scoped to the associated DataReaderImpl or
DataWriterImpl which created it.  These instance handles are not intended 
to be mixed with entity instance handles.  The sole exception to this rule is
when a Builtin Topic is used to lookup an entity which is then passed to one
of the ignore_* operations on the DomainParticipant (see below).

Unlike entity instance handles, data instance handles do not maintain any
additional state which need purging.

The InstanceHandle_t type is currently a typedef to a CORBA long in
DdsDcpsInfrastructure.idl.  The lower 4 bits of the overall 32-bit value
contains a kind field (InstanceHandleKind) that indicates the kind of handle.
The upper 28 bits are a sequence which allows for up to 268,435,456 instance
handles be assigned per kind.

InstanceHandle_t:
31..............24..............16..............8.......4.......0
+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
|                         sequence(28)                  |kind(4)|
+---------------+---------------+---------------+---------------+
      (MSB)                                           (LSB)

The InstanceHandleKind field allows the DomainParticipantImpl to perform
additional error checking in the various ignore_* operations.  If a data
instance handle is passed to an ignore operation, it is assumed that it 
corresponds to an entity referenced by a Builtin Topic.  The RepoId will
then be generated from the BuiltinTopicKey_t for that instance and used.

InstanceHandleKind Enumeration:
0x0 KIND_UNKNOWN
0x1 KIND_PARTICIPANT
0x2 KIND_TOPIC
0x3 KIND_SUBSCRIBER
0x4 KIND_PUBLISHER
0x5 KIND_DATAREADER
0x6 KIND_DATAWRITER
0xF KIND_DATA

The DCPSInfoRepo must have all references to InstanceHandle_t removed.  As the
scope and responsibility for generating these values has now shifted to
DomainParticipantImpl, it is no longer neccessary (or correct) for the
DCPSInfoRepo to be aware of an assigned instance handle.
