. Added files necessary to generate automake makefiles.  The following
  command must be used to generate them from MPC:

  $MPC_ROOT/mwc.pl -include $ACE_ROOT/bin/MakeProjectCreator/config -type automake DDS.mwc

  You must not run mwc.pl from $ACE_ROOT/bin to do this.

  The ACE_ROOT, TAO_ROOT and DDS_ROOT environment variables must be set. 
  Additionally, ACE_BUILDDIR should be set to $ACE_ROOT and TAO_BUILDDIR
  should be set to $TAO_ROOT.

  Please note that this is experimental and has not been fully tested.
