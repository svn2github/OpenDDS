  // that are each managed by an ACE_Data_Block, each of which is
  // managed by an ACE_Message_Block containing the read and write
  // pointers into the data.
  //
  // As messages are parsed, new ACE_Message_Blocks will be formed with
  // read and write pointers adjusted to reference the individual
  // DataSample buffer contents.

  // The Underlying buffers, ACE_Data_Blocks, and ACE_Message_Blocks
  // will be acquired from a Cached_Allocater_with_overflow.  The size
  // of the individual data buffers will be set initially to the
  // ethernet MTU to allow for full TCP messages to be received into
  // individual blocks.
  //
  // Reading will be performed with a two member struct iov, to allow
  // for the remainder of the current buffer to be used along with at
  // least one completely empty buffer.  There will be a low water
  // parameter used to stop the use of the current block when the
  // available space in it is reduced.
