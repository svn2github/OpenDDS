/**
 * @class TransportQueueElement
 *
 * @brief Base wrapper class around a data/control sample to be sent.
 *
 * This class serves as the base class for different types of samples
 * that can be sent.  For example, there are data samples and control
 * samples.  A subclass of TransportQueueElement exists for each of
 * these types of samples.
 *
 * This class maintains a counter that, when decremented to 0, will
 * trigger some logic (defined in the subclass) that will "return
 * the loan" of the sample.  The sample is "loaned" to the transport
 * via a send() or send_control() call on the TransportInterface.
 * This wrapper object will "return the loan" when all DataLinks have
 * "returned" their sub-loans.
