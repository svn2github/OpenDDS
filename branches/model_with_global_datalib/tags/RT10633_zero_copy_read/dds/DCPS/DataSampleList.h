    * List elements include the marshaled message, the publication Id and
    * Instance handle for downstream processing, and three separate threads
    * allowing the elements to reside simultaneously on four different
    * lists of data:
    *
    *   next_sample_ / previous_sample
    *     - the next sample of data in the DataWriter.  This thread is used
    *       to traverse elements in the order in which they were written to
    *       the DataWriter (within PRESENTATION.access_scope==TOPIC).
    *       This thread will be used to hold the element in one of four
    *       different lists in the WriteDataContainer: the unsent_data_
    *       list, the sending_data_ list, the sent_data_ list, or the 
    *       released_data_ list at different times during its lifetime.  
    *       This has a double link to allow removal of elements from internal
    *       locations in the list.
    *
    *   next_instance_sample_
    *     - the next sample of data in the instance within the DataWriter.
    *       This thread is used to traverse elements in the
    *       order in which they were written to the instance (within
    *       PRESENTAION.access_scope==INSTANCE).  It is mainly used on the
    *       send side to count the depth of instance data and to allow the
    *       removal of elements by instance.
    *
    *   next_send_sample_
    *     - the next sample of data to be sent.  This thread is used
    *       external to the container to maintain a list of data samples
    *       that are to be transmitted over the transport layer. The
    *       Publisher may use this thread to maintain a list of samples to
    *       be sent with PRESENTATION.access_scope==GROUP by obtaining
    *       data from each DataWriter as it becomes available and
    *       concatentating the data in the order in which it was written.
    *
    * We thread this single element rather than having multiple smaller
    * lists in order to allow us to allocat once and have the element
    * contained in all of the lists in which it will be held during its
    * lifetime.  These three threads will at times hold the element in
    * three separate lists simultaneously.  The next_sample_ thread will be
    * used in the container to hold the element in one of three different
    * lists at different times, so a single thread is all that is required
    * for all of those lists.
    *
    * NOTE: this is what we want to pass into the enqueue method of the
    *       container, since we want to centralize the
    *       allocation/deallocation so that we can minimize locking.  By
    *       grabbing a single lock, allocating the
    *       buffer/Data_Block/Message_Block/DataSampleListElement at the
    *       same time, we only pay once for all of the allocations.  They
    *       are all presumably from a cache (for the most part) anyway, so
    *       it should be fairly quick.
