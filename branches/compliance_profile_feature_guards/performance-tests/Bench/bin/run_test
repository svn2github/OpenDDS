=head1 NAME

run_test - Execute test processes for distributed testing

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 run_test [options]

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 8

=item B<-?> | B<--help>

Print a brief help message and exits.

=item B<--man>

Prints this manual page and exits.

=item B<-x> | B<--noaction>

Print the commands that would be executed with the current set of command
line options and exit without starting any processes.

=item B<-v> | B<--verbose>

Print additional information while executing.

=item B<-V> | B<--ORBVerboseLogging=NUMBER>

Sets the -ORBVerboseLogging option to NUMBER.

The default value is 0.

The value is set to 1 if any non-zero value is specified.  A value of
zero will omit the ORBVerboseLogging specification from the process
command line.

=item B<-d NUMBER> | B<--debug=NUMBER>

Sets the -DCPSDebugLevel option value.  A value of 0 will omit the
DCPSDebugLevel specification from the process command line.

The default value is 0.

=item B<-T NUMBER> | B<--tdebug=NUMBER>

Sets the -DCPSTransportDebugLevel option value.  A value of 0 will omit
the DCPSTransportDebugLevel specification from the process command line.

The default value is 0.

=item B<-R NUMBER> | B<--rdebug=NUMBER>

Sets the -DCPSDebugLevel option value for the repository process.  A
value of 0 will omit the DCPSDebugLevel specification from the repository
process command line.

The default value is 0.

=item B<-t NUMBER> | B<--duration=NUMBER>

Limits the execution time of the test.  If not specified, then any test
or repository process that is started will execute until the script is
interrupted.

The default value is unspecified.

=item B<-S> | B<--startrepo>

Causes a repository process to be started.  Only a single repository
process will be invoked by an invocation.

The default value is to not start a repository process.

=item B<-P> | B<--starttest>

Causes one or more test processes to be started.  One process will be
started for each test file specified by the B<-s> option.

The default value is to not start a test process.

=item B<-f FILE> | B<--dfile=FILE>

Sets the -ORBLogFile option value.  A value of unspecified will result in
the ORBLogFile specification being omitted from the process command line.

The default value is unspecified.

=item B<-C TYPES> | B<--collect=TYPES>

Starts statistics collection for the specified TYPES.  TYPES may contain
one or more of the values: C<n>, C<s>, and C<p>, or the collective
specification C<all>.
The output for any given statistic is placed in a file named as specified
by the B<-O FORMAT> command line option.  The default is to a file with a
basename of the TYPE and a decorator of C<-<pidE<gt>.log>.

=over 8

=item B<n>

Causes network statistics to be gathered.  A C<netstat -ntpc> command is
started for each test process and the output filtered by its process Id.

=item B<s>

Causes system statistics to be gathered.  A single C<vmstat 1> command is
started.  If the PID value is specified as part of the statistic
filename, the PID value for the test script process is used.

=item B<p>

Causes process statistics to be gathered.  A C<top -bd 1 -p {pid}>
command is started for each test process and the output filtered by its
process Id.

=item B<all>

Causes all statistics described above to be gathered.  This is a synonym
for I<nsp>

=back

The default is unspecified.  This results in no statistics being
collected.

=item B<-O FORMAT> | B<--outputdecorator=FORMAT>

Establishes the format of the statistics gathering output file names.
The format is specified as a string with simple substitution performed to
replace some characters with other information.  This is a simple
substitution and no escapes are allowed.

Statistics output filenames are formed starting with the type of
statistic being gathered concatenated with the decorater defined here,
expanded with the formatting information at the time of execution.  The
types of statistics currently include C<system>, C<process>, and
C<network>.

The characters replaced in the format specification are:

=over 8

=item B<P>

replaced with the process PID for being monitored.

=item B<T>

replaced with a timestamp that includes a 4 digit year, 2 digit month, 2
digit day of month, 2 digit hour, 2 digit minute, and 2 digit second.
The timestamp is taken near the time the statistics collection is started.

=item B<H>

replaced by the hostname of the machine executing the script.

=back

The default is "-P.log" which results in output files with names similar
to C<system-5436.log>.

=item B<-h FQDN> | B<--repohost=FQDN>

This is the fully qualified domain name and port where the OpenDDS
repository may be found.

The default value is 'localhost:2112'.

=item B<-i FILE> | B<--inifile=FILE>

OpenDDS configuration filename.  This defines the configuration
information for the OpenDDS service.

The default is to use the file located in the 'etc' directory relative
from the project root (the parent directory of the directory where the
command was executed from) with filename 'transport.ini'.

=item B<-s FILELIST> | B<--scenario=FILELIST>

Test scenario definition filenames.  This defines the scenarios to execute
for the test.  This names an 'ini' style file that contains information
about all publications and subscriptions to execute for this test
execution.  This can be one or more filenames, separated by commas.  One
test process will be started (if requested) to process each named
scenario configuration file.

The default is not specified.  This will result in no test processes
being started if the B<-P> argument is given.

=item B<-r FILE> | B<--rawdatafile=FILE>  [DEPRECATED]

Raw data output filename.  This file is where any raw latency data
collected during the test will be written.

The default is unspecified.

I<This is deprecated in favor of the test configuration specification for
this filename.>

=back

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This script manages execution of the processes needed for distributed
testing of OpenDDS using the OpenDDS-Bench performance testing framework.
The processes used by the framework include the OpenDDS specific
repository process and the test specific process.  The repository
executable is the standard OpenDDS C<DCPSInfoRepo> program.  The framework
C<testprocess> program is specific to this testing and provides the
ability to start multiple publications and / or subscriptions within a
single process.

It is possible to start any number of C<testprocess> programs at once.
A separate process will be started for each configuration file supplied.
The same configuration file can be included more than once to start
separate processes with the same configuration.

Processes started by this script will either execute until terminated by
the user (no duration specified) or until a specified duration has
elapsed.  For the C<testprocess> commands, the duration is passed to the
program to allow it to terminate cleanly.  The script will wait 60
seconds beyond this time and then terminate the process by force.

This script will establish the environment for the executable processes
by adding the test library to the runtime library search path.

=head1 EXAMPLES

=over 8

=item B<bin/run_test -vx -P -s s1.ini>

prints the commands that would be invoked when starting a single test
process with the s1.ini test specification.  This will also be verbose
during setup processing.

=item B<bin/run_test -d 10 -C n -T 4 -P -s test.ini -f test.log -h localhost:2038>

starts a test process using the C<test.ini> specification file and expecting
to find the repository process at localhost:2038.  It will run with
C<DCPSDebugLevel> of 10, C<DCPSTransportDebugLevel> of 4 and put the logging
output to the C<test.log> file.  Network statistics will be gathered for
connections to the test process.

=item B<bin/run_test -x -t 120 -s scenario1.ini,scenario1.ini,other.ini>

prints the commands that would be invoked when starting 3 test processes:
two using the scenario1.ini specification file and one using the other.ini
specification file.  The test would be scheduled to last for 2 minutes.

=item B<bin/run_test -vd10T4VCall -O-H-T-P.log -s test.ini -h machine.domain.com:2112>

starts a test process using the C<test.ini> specification file and
expecting to connect to the repository at C<machine.domain.com:2112>.  It
will run with C<DCPSDebugLevel> of 10, C<DCPSTransportDebugLevel> of 4,
C<ORBVerboseLogging> enabled and both the script and test process will
execute in verbose mode.  The log output will be directed to the standard
output.

All statistics - system, network, and process - will be gathered.
Statistics will be placed in files named using the statistic type, the
hostname, a timestamp, and the PID of the monitored process.  These
filenames will appear as: C<system-<hostE<gt>-<timeE<gt>-<pidE<gt>.log>,
C<process-<hostE<gt>-<timeE<gt>-<pidE<gt>.log>, and
C<network-<hostE<gt>-<timeE<gt>-<pidE<gt>.log>.
