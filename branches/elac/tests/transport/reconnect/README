This test currently requires installation of the socat utility is /usr/bin
on the system being tested.  This utility should eventually be replaced 
with a custom built utility using ACE.

The run_test.pl starts a simple publisher that connects to socat which
in turn connects to the simple subscriber.  The publisher begins 
publishing samples (one per message) through socat.  After a delay,
socat is killed and restarted by the run_test.pl script, forcing a 
reconnect.  The publisher, continues publishing until the expexted 
number of messages are received while the socat utility is repeatedly
killed and more reconnects are forced.
