        * tests/DCPS/DCPSInfoRepo/pubsub.cpp:

          Moved setting of ORB from ServiceParticipant to
          InfoRepoDiscovery.

        * tests/DCPS/unit/Main.cpp:
        * tests/DCPS/unit/README:

        * Merged r5637 through r5646 from trunk.

        * Merged r5511 through r5636 from trunk. Note there are still
          compile errors because Service_Participant no longer has
          member functions set_ORB() and the_POA().

        * dds/DCPS/Service_Participant.cpp:
        * dds/DCPS/Service_Participant.h:

          Service_Participant no longer manages the ORB and the POA.
          There is a new API "timer()" to get the ACE_Reactor_Timer_Interface
          which can be used for scheduling timers but not for Reactor I/O.

        * dds/DCPS/DataDurabilityCache.cpp:
        * dds/DCPS/DataReaderImpl.cpp:
        * dds/DCPS/DataWriterImpl.cpp:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/DataLink.cpp:

          Adapted to the modified Service_Participant API.

        * dds/DCPS/InfoRepoDiscovery/InfoRepoDiscovery.cpp:
        * dds/DCPS/InfoRepoDiscovery/InfoRepoDiscovery.h:

          InfoRepoDiscovery is now responsible for the ORB and the POA.

        * dds/DCPS/RTPS/RtpsDiscovery.cpp:
        * dds/DCPS/RTPS/RtpsDiscovery.h:
        * dds/DCPS/RTPS/Spdp.cpp:

          Use a Reactor managed by the RtpsDiscovery object.

        * dds/InfoRepo/DCPSInfoRepoServ.cpp:
        * dds/InfoRepo/FederatorManagerImpl.cpp:

          The ORB is now managed by the InfoRepoDiscovery objet.

        * tests/DCPS/LivelinessTest/publisher.cpp:

          Replaced TheServiceParticipant->get_ORB()
          with the new timer() accessor.
