/** The TransportImpl class includes the abstract methods that must be implemented
*   by any implementation to provide data delivery service to the DCPS implementation.
*   This includes methods to send data, received data, configure the operation, and
*   manage associations and datalinks between local and remote objects of the implementation.
*
*   Notes about object ownership:
*   1)Has longer lifetime than the publisher and subscriber objects. The publishers
*     and subscribers are owned by the DomainParticipant and transport factory shutdown
*     is always after DomainParticipant factory shutdown.
*   2)The concrete transport object owns the datalink objects.
*   3)Own  a DataLinkCleanup object.
*   4)Reference to TransportInst object and TransportReactorTask object owned
*     by TransportFactory.
*   5)During transport shutdown, if this object does not have ownership of an object
*     but has a references via smart pointer then the reference should be freed;
*     if this object has ownership of task objects then the tasks should be closed.
