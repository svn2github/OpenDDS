monitor - instrumentation viewer application for OpenDDS.

This application provides a GUI view into instrumentation of the OpenDDS
service.

Documentation describing how to build and execute the application is
included at doc/userguide.html.  That includes establishing the build and
execution environments as well.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Code notes:

The GUI source code files are compiled by the Qt meta-object compiler and
have certain macros and other non-standard language constructs that are
parsed by that system.

This means that it is not recommended to run a style utility on the GUI
files, as the Qt specific elements may no longer be recognizable by the
Qt tools.

Currently the GUI files that should not be reformatted include:
  all generated files
  Monitor_main.cpp
  MonitorDataModel.{h,cpp}
  TreeNode.h
  Viewer.{h,cpp}
