	**Where modifications not specifically noted, added debugging logging

        * dds/DCPS/DataWriterImpl.cpp:
				-removed logging of publication_id_ prior to it being set
        * dds/DCPS/PublisherImpl.cpp:
        * dds/DCPS/Service_Participant.cpp:

        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/DataLink.inl:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/DataLink.cpp:
				-modified how invoke_on_start_callbacks operates.  
				 Instead of swapping out the vector of callbacks, 
				 iterate over them.  This allows callbacks to be 
				 removed while one is being processed.  And thus 
				 removes possibility of calling use_datalink on a 
				 previously deleted TransportClient
        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/TransportClient.cpp:
				-added locking to destructor
        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/TransportImpl.cpp:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/TransportInst.cpp:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/TransportRegistry.cpp:

        * dds/DCPS/transport/tcp/TcpConnection.cpp:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/tcp/TcpTransport.cpp:
				-modified connect_datalink to properly add_pending_connection 
				 in situations where a new link was created and on_start_callback 
				 was added before returning nil link with ACR_SUCCESS
